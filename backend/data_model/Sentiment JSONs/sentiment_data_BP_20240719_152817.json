(BP): Why Is Bluebell Capital Partners Targeting This Stock Right Now?", "Summary": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Targeted by Activist Investors Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) stands against the other stocks targeted by activist investors.\nActivist investors play an important role in deploying various strategies to try and unlock value in stocks they believe are trading below their fair value. By paying millions and even billions of dollars to buy stakes in companies, they accrue significant power and the right to lobby for changes they believe will help bolster share price and shareholder value. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that the top 10 stocks targeted by activist investors right now have also seen their leadership targeted as one of the ways of engineering changes to unlock value.\nLast year alone, companies faced a record number of activist campaigns as shareholders tried to insert optimum pressure to oust directors of companies struggling amid deteriorating macro conditions. Some activist investors went to the extent of pushing for the sale of businesses whose shares had tumbled significantly.\nConsequently, there were 252 activist campaigns globally in 2023, a 7% increase from the previous year. The fact that the top 10 stocks targeted by activist investors now also include blue-chip businesses underlines that no one is safe from scrutiny.\nThe significant increase in activist campaigns came from geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, activist investors shrugged off these concerns as they showed their resilience in pushing for corporate changes and operational efficiency in the race to unlock shareholder value.\nSimilarly, investors closely watch activist investors' moves in the market as they help shed light on some of the best-undervalued opportunities worth exploring. A report of 550 activist campaigns has already shown that activist investors often outperform the overall market by 6.3% through their campaigns. The report by \u00c1lvaro & Marshal clearly shows why it is essential to closely watch activist investors' moves when trying to uncover high-risk reward opportunities in the market.\nAdditionally, activist campaigns focused on operational demands to change how companies operate to generate value often outperform the market by 9.4% on average. The outperformance stems from activist investors installing their preferred directors on the board of directors to try and influence how a company operates in its push to unlock shareholder value.\nOne trend that is becoming increasingly clear is that activist campaigns are becoming increasingly regional and dynamic. With the US equities outperforming the overall market over the past few years, activist investors are increasingly targeting stocks in other underperforming regions. Consequently, the activist investors launched 69 campaigns in Europe last year, focusing on pushing for mergers and acquisitions. Equities in Asia Pacific were not spared either, going by the 44 new campaigns.\nWhile the UK recorded a 71% increase in activist campaigns to 29 campaigns and the US recorded a 20% drop to 109 campaigns in 2024, Canada saw a 171% increase in shareholder activism to 19 campaigns. Nevertheless, US-based activist investors continue to account for the most significant share of global activist campaigns. For instance, three of the busiest US-based activist investors launched 14% of the worldwide activist campaigns.\nOver the years, activist campaigns have been dominated by high-profile hedge funds, including Icahn Enterprises, Jana Partners and Trian Partners. Elliott Investment Management is one activist hedge fund that stands out when it comes to unlocking value in under two years.\nThe trend is slowly changing, with new, more aggressive funds pushing to make their mark. For instance, more than 40% of campaigns last year were spearheaded by hedge funds for the first time, especially in Europe. The change of guard stems from the barrier of entry being lowered, giving shareholders the ability to launch more campaigns.\nIt is one of the best times to watch the 10 stocks targeted by activist Investors right now, as the campaigns are highly successful. The double-digit returns posted by activist investors in 2023 in one of the most challenging environments amid the high interest rates underscores the effectiveness of some campaigns.\nFor instance, activist investors who pushed for management changes and the streamlining of operations enjoyed an average return of 20.2% in 2023, a significant improvement from an average loss of 16% in 2022. Even as the S&P 500 gained 24%, activist investors like Mason Morfit's ValueAct Capital came out on top, posting a 39% return, while Bill Ackman's Pershing Square holdings delivered a 27% gain. Healthcare-focused hedge fund Caligan Partners posted a 37% gain as Engaged Capital topped the S&P 500 gain with a 29% gain.\nThe activist campaigns were mainly helped by a rising stock market and focused on some of the most prominent stock picks on a roll, like Nvidia for AI and cloud computing powerhouse Salesforce. The campaigns also turned out to be a great success for the activist investors pushing for cost cuts, strategic alternatives, and management changes to navigate the high interest rate environment.\nIn the first half of 2024, activist investors launched a record number of campaigns, 147 of which topped the previous 143 set in 2018. In the second quarter, they launched 86 campaigns, with Elliott Capital emerging as the busiest, launching 11 campaigns and investing $11 billion in the capital in a bid to enhance its influence in its targets\nThe surge in activist campaigns in 2024 threatens to trigger costly boardroom battles as the activist investor pushes for management changes, spin-offs, and outright sales.\nOur Methodology\nA closer look at how shareholders push for optimum value shows that activist investors are not planning to go slow anytime soon. Instead, they are ready to push companies harder for changes, including accelerating board changes to unlock value. Consequently, we have compiled a list of the most recent activist campaigns and ranked them based on their recent market capitalization. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA large turbine generating power from natural gas, smoke rising in the background.\nBluebell Capital Partners at the BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)\nMarket Cap: $78.79 Billion\nBluebell Capital Partners' Equity Stake: N/A\nBP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the top 10 stocks targeted by activist investors right now on the belief that the oil and gas company is undervalued. Bluebell Capital Partners has already launched an activist campaign against BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), insisting management take several steps to ensure it remains on its path to generating shareholder value.\nThe changes include the company slowing its commitment to reduce oil and gas production by 25% by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions. The activist investor is also challenging BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)' s plan to focus on its transition businesses, including charging, renewables and hydrogen.\n\"primarily due to an ill-conceived strategy aimed at drastically shrinking BP's core business (oil and gas), on the one hand, and rapidly promoting a risky diversification into sectors with lower targeted returns and where BP has 'no right to win,\" Bluebell Capital said in a statement.\nAccording to the activist investor, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)' s push to diversify away from its core oil and gas business into renewables and other projects lowers returns on capital and reduces value generation for shareholders.\nOverall BP ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks targeted by activist investors right now.

(BP): Here is What You Need to Know", "Summary": "BP (BP) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this oil and gas company have returned +0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which BP falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nBP is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.4%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.46 points to a change of -6.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 indicates a change of +16% from what BP is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for BP.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for BP _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor BP, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $62.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +26.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $239.78 billion and $256.49 billion estimates indicate +12.6% and +7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBP reported revenues of $49.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.3%. EPS of $0.97 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -19.12%. The EPS surprise was -5.83%.\nThe company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBP is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about BP. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This hydrogen will be generated through the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity, primarily sourced through an offshore wind power purchase agreement.\nThe green hydrogen produced will be utilized at BP\u2019s Lingen refinery and supplied to local industries, including steel and chemical producers, aiding in the decarbonization of their production processes.\nThe project, which was initially outlined in 2020 in collaboration with Orsted A/S, has now been expanded to a 100-MW capacity. Although Orsted has since withdrawn, BP has proceeded with the development, receiving vital funding from the Lower Saxony regional government and Germany\u2019s Economy Ministry. This support is part of the European Union\u2019s IPCEI Hy2Infra initiative, aimed at fostering the hydrogen economy across Europe.\nThe green hydrogen initiative at Lingen is a milestone for BP and the broader energy sector in Germany. By replacing traditional fossil fuels with green hydrogen, the project will contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. This aligns with Germany\u2019s broader objectives to pivot away from natural gas and coal, thereby supporting industrial decarbonization.\nBP's green hydrogen project at Lingen surpasses similar projects, such as Shell Plc\u2019s SHEL Rheinland refinery, which launched a 10-MW electrolyzer in 2021. Shell aims to become a top supplier of green hydrogen for industrial and transport customers in Germany.\nAdditionally, BP is exploring green hydrogen production at its Castellon refinery in Spain, further emphasizing its commitment to sustainable energy solutions. With a history spanning more than 70 years, BP's Lingen refinery has been a cornerstone of energy supply for the German industry. The transition to green hydrogen marks a new chapter in its legacy, positioning BP at the forefront of the energy transition in Germany and Europe.\nBP\u2019s Lingen green hydrogen project is set to play a crucial role in developing a hydrogen economy, serving as a building block for a sustainable energy transition. As Germany and Europe strive to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy security, initiatives like BP\u2019s green hydrogen plant at Lingen will be instrumental in shaping a cleaner and greener future.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked companies mentioned below.

While we still rely on traditional resources, the focus is shifting toward cleaner, more sustainable solutions. This trend is exemplified by the recently announced Ruwais liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Abu Dhabi, marking a significant collaboration between the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (\u201cADNOC\u201d) and three leading European energy companies, namely Shell plc SHEL, BP plc BP and TotalEnergies SE TTE.\nSHEL, BP and TTE have secured a 10% stake each in the Ruwais LNG project. This strategic partnership positions ADNOC, the state-owned oil company of the United Arab Emirates, and these energy giants at the forefront of developing one of the world's lowest carbon-intensive LNG facilities.\nSituated in Al Ruwais Industrial City, the Ruwais LNG project will be the first LNG export facility in the Middle East and North Africa region to use clean power for its operations. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and artificial intelligence (AI), the project is aimed at minimizing emissions and maximizing operational efficiency, with a total capacity of 9.6 million tons per annum (mtpa).\nThe Ruwais LNG project is set to greatly enhance the United Arab Emirates\u2019 LNG export capacity. Scheduled to begin operations in the latter half of 2028, it is expected to strengthen the country\u2019s status as a key player in the global LNG market.\nAs per agreements, ADNOC will have a controlling 60% stake in the Ruwais LNG project and take the lead as its developer and operator. However, SHEL, BP and TTE are also positioned to gain from their investments.\nExpanding LNG Portfolio: The project should allow the aforementioned companies to further grow their world-leading LNG portfolios. As Wael Sawan, Shell's CEO, mentioned, \"In line with our strategy to create more value with less emissions, we are investing in additional LNG capacity and further growing our world-leading LNG portfolio with energy-efficient and carbon-competitive projects.\"\nShell, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, also announced that its deal includes an offtake agreement to purchase 1 mtpa of LNG. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nReducing Carbon Intensity: The Ruwais LNG facility is designed to be one of the world's lowest carbon-intensive LNG plants, leveraging clean power and the latest technologies to minimize emissions. This aligns with the companies' decarbonization goals. As TotalEnergies' CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 highlighted, \"With Ruwais LNG, we are implementing this principle by establishing one of the world's lowest-carbon intensity LNG plants, enabling natural gas to effectively serve as a transitional fuel.\"\nThis France-based multi-energy company produces and markets oil and biofuels, natural gas, green gases, renewables, and electricity in the rest of Europe, North America, Africa and internationally. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company aims to be a net-zero carbon emission company by 2050 and has taken the necessary steps to achieve this goal.\nStrengthening Partnerships: The investments deepen the strategic partnerships between these major European companies and ADNOC. This allows for knowledge sharing, collaboration on innovation and potential opportunities.\nThe CEO of BP remarked, \u201cBP is proud to be joining ADNOC in its plans for Ruwais LNG, deepening our long-standing strategic partnership. This is a further example of our investment in gas growth in the Middle East as we continue to strengthen our LNG business globally.\u201d This Zacks Rank #3 company aims for a 25 mtpa of LNG portfolio by 2025.\nAccessing Growth Markets: The project positions the companies to capitalize on the growing global demand for natural gas as a transitional fuel. By participating in this major LNG project in the Middle East, they gain a strategic foothold in a key growth market.\nBoosting Local Industrial Development: The Ruwais LNG project is expected to accelerate the development of the Al Ruwais Industrial City, creating skilled private sector jobs for the UAE nationals and supporting the local industrial ecosystem. This also aligns with the country\u2019s economic diversification goals.\nThe partnership also highlights Abu Dhabi's attractiveness as an investment destination for international energy players, as emphasized by His Highness Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The UAE's focus on driving efficiency, enhancing workforce capabilities and investing in clean energy solutions has created a favorable environment for such strategic collaborations.\nADNOC has also signed several new long-term LNG sales commitments with SHEL and Tokyo-based Mitsui & Co., taking the committed Ruwais LNG production capacity to 70%. This demonstrates the growing global demand for natural gas as a transitional fuel and the UAE's positioning as a key player in meeting this demand.\nIn conclusion, the Ruwais LNG investment allows Shell, BP and TotalEnergies to expand their LNG portfolios, reduce carbon intensity, strengthen key partnerships, access growth markets and contribute to local industrial development \u2014 all of which provide long-term strategic and commercial benefits for these major energy companies.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Granholm. \u201cEven as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive--and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\u2019\u2019 she added.\nLast week, GM announced it has received a $500 million federal grant to help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already invested over $12 billion in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020.\nRelated: Houthis Showcase Drone Boat as Another Merchant Ship Falls Victim\nThe grants were hotly contested, with the DoE revealing it received four times as many applicants as grant recipients. DoE says all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.\nThe selected projects will create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House has said. According to the DoE, the new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office.\nThe UAW has, however, warned that a too rapid transition from ICE to EVs could put thousands of jobs at risk in key states such as Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\nUAW President Shawn Fain has applauded the announcement, saying the grants and loans \"makes clear to employers that the EV transition must include strong union partnerships with the high pay and safety standards that generations of UAW members have fought for and won.\"\nImpact On Oil Demand\nWith the year at the midpoint, the EV boom shows no signs of slowing down.\nEV sales globally have now hit 18% of all new vehicle sales, with BEV sales up by 14% YoY in April, while plugin hybrids jumped 51% YoY. A big driver of the EV megatrend is falling costs, with Tesla Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) most affordable model now $6,500 cheaper than its ICE peer, the cheapest BMW 3 Series, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Gartner has predicted that EVs will be cheaper to produce than ICE vehicles of the same size in only three years, thanks in large part to improvements in manufacturing methods with production costs dropping faster than battery costs.\n\u201cNew OEM incumbents want to heavily redefine the status quo in automotive. They brought new innovations that simplify production costs such as centralized vehicle architecture or the introduction of gigacastings that help reduce manufacturing cost and assembly time, which legacy automakers had no choice to adopt to survive, \u201dPedro Pacheco, vice president of research at Gartner, has said.\nRapid EV adoption has elicited dire predictions for the oil sector. Last year, Bloomberg predicted that global demand for road fuel will peak in 2027 at 49 million barrels per day driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, ever-improving fuel efficiency, and shared mobility. Just a week ago, British Oil & Gas giant BP Plc (NYSE:BP) predicted that global oil demand will peak next year while wind and solar capacity will continue to grow rapidly.\nIn its latest edition of its annual Energy Outlook, BP has published a study of the evolution of the global energy system to 2050.  BP has modeled its predictions on two key scenarios: The Current Trajectory and Net Zero. BP has predicted that oil demand will peak by 2025 at around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) under both scenarios.\nHowever, the rate of decline thereafter will be determined primarily by the pace of falling oil use in road transport. In the Current Trajectory, BP sees oil consumption gradually declining over the second half of the outlook to around 75 million bpd in 2050. The drop is, however, much more pronounced in Net Zero, with demand falling somewhere between 25 million and 30 million bpd by 2050.\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nU.S. Oil, Gas Drilling Activity Continues To Drop\nSuriname\u2019s Mega Oil Boom Is Back on Track\nBrent Tops $86 on Hopes of Fed Cut in September\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Big-Auto-Eyes-2B-Govt-220000775.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.909973979, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "BP", "Time": "2024-07-15T13:01:00.000Z", "Headline": "BP Ups Oil & Gas Demand Forecasts Amid Slow Clean Energy Shift", "Summary": "BP plc (BP) has projected that the global oil demand will peak next year, with wind and solar capacity set to expand rapidly under both main scenarios outlined in its annual Energy Outlook. The report, which studies the evolution of the global energy system up to 2050, suggests significant shifts in energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions. The energy giant highlighted these projections in its annual outlook, cautioning that a delay in the shift to renewable power could prove \"costly.\"\nScenarios and Emissions\nBP's Energy Outlook presents two scenarios \u2014 the Current Trajectory and the Net Zero scenario. Both scenarios predict that carbon emissions, predominantly from fossil fuels, will peak in the mid-2020s. The Current Trajectory scenario is based on existing climate policies and carbon reduction commitments. In contrast, the Net Zero scenario assumes stricter climate policies aligned with the Paris Agreement, aiming for a 95% reduction in carbon emissions by mid-century.\nIn the Current Trajectory scenario, primary energy demand continues to rise until the mid-2030s, then stabilizes. By 2050, energy demand is projected to be around 5% higher than in 2022. Conversely, the Net Zero scenario sees energy demand peaking mid-decade and declining thereafter, with a 25% reduction by 2050 compared to 2022.\nOil and Natural Gas\nAccording to the outlook, oil demand is expected to peak around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 under both scenarios. However, the rate of decline varies.\nIn the Current Trajectory, oil consumption is expected to drop to around 75 million bpd by 2050, while in the Net Zero scenario, the decline is likely to be in the range of 25-30 million bpd. Oil demand is expected to reach approximately 97.8 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2035, based on the current global energy system trajectory. This figure marks an upward revision of more than 5% compared to last year's forecast when BP had significantly reduced its growth expectations for both oil and gas.\nNatural gas demand shows contrasting trends in the two scenarios. Under the Current Trajectory, demand should increase around 20% by 2050, driven by substantial growth in emerging economies. In the Net Zero scenario, gas demand is expected to peak mid-decade and then halve by 2050, with 80% of consumption abated through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. BP's forecast for natural gas demand in 2035 has also risen 3% compared to last year's projection.\nThe last increase in oil demand projections for 2030 occurred in 2022, while gas projections were previously raised in 2018. Despite the increased demand for fossil fuels, BP anticipates that CO2 emission levels will be lower by 2050 under both the current trajectory and net zero scenarios.\nRenewable Energy\nBoth scenarios predict a substantial increase in renewable energy capacity. Wind and solar power are expected to grow eight-fold by 2050 in the Current Trajectory scenario and 14-fold in the Net Zero scenario. Until 2035, China and developed economies will lead the expansion, each contributing 30-45% of new capacity.\nLNG Demand\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) demand is anticipated to grow rapidly until 2030, with a 40% and 30% increase in the Current Trajectory and the Net Zero scenarios, respectively, compared to the 2022 levels. Post-2030, LNG demand will continue to rise by more than 25% in the Current Trajectory, necessitating additional liquefaction capacity. However, the Net Zero scenario forecasts a reversal in gains post-2030, with global LNG trade dropping 40% below 2022 levels by 2050.\nConclusion\nBP's Energy Outlook highlights the critical transitions facing the global energy landscape. While the report did not explicitly state the reasons for the revised forecasts, it noted that under the current trajectory, the decline in oil use for road transport is balanced by its increasing use in the petrochemicals industry.\nIn emerging economies, growing prosperity and rising living standards are expected to support robust oil demand. BP's latest outlook indicates a complex and evolving energy landscape, where the pace of the transition to renewable energy sources must accelerate to meet global targets and mitigate the potential costs of delay.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nBP currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like Hess Corporation HES, Sunoco LP SUN and SM Energy Company SM, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

EV sales are slowing, wind and solar capacity additions are not expanding fast enough, and electricity is getting more instead of less expensive.\nWith those signs, others have been flashing red, too. Despite the push against oil and gas, these are here to stay for the long haul\u2014and demand won\u2019t even decline that much after peaking, according to the latest energy outlook of BP.\nThe supermajor, which used to compile the Statistical Review of World Energy, now does its own review. And according to its latest edition, oil demand will peak next year. And it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s called the peak for oil demand.\nThe last time its statistical review said that demand growth had peaked\u2014in 2019\u2014it turned out to be very wrong. In reality, oil demand soared after the end of the pandemic lockdowns to reach new all-time highs.\nNow, BP has noted that over the past five years, oil demand has been growing at an average of half a million barrels daily since 2019, but that is about to end, with demand on the decline over the next couple of decades. But here\u2019s the thing. Before, BP forecast that this decline would be quite substantial. Now, it expects that in 2035, the world will still consume 97.8 million barrels of oil per day in 2035, which would be a relatively minor decline from the current rate of consumption, which is about 100 million barrels daily, which may rise above that this year if demand strengthens in the second half.\nIn other words, BP acknowledges that the human civilization\u2019s dependence on hydrocarbons will not be so easy to shake simply by embracing alternative energy sources. What\u2019s more, primary energy demand is still on an upward trajectory, and hydrocarbons will be the energy sources to respond to much of that\u2014until we start needing less energy.\nIt is energy demand that is key to the success of the transition to energy sources that leave a lot to be desired in areas such as energy density and storage costs. To make them work, we need to consume less rather than more energy. Indeed, if governments and the business world suddenly find all the money and regulatory support that the transition needs, energy demand growth will peak by next year under BP\u2019s Net Zero scenario.\nUnlike that perfect-case scenario, the Current Trajectory scenario points to energy demand growth continuing until the middle of the next decade before peaking and then plateauing\u2014because the developing world would continue to need more energy.\nThe BP outlook essentially outlines a deepening divide between the developed world, which is where the transition push began and where it has been the strongest, and the developing world, where access to energy is still a luxury in many places. Yet as developing economies grow, this luxury would become accessible to more people, and these people would be consuming ever more energy until they hit a peak.\nThe fact that the developing world is driving the increase in oil and gas demand while the developed world has seen a minor decline in its own demand for these\u2014at the significant expense of deindustrialization\u2014highlights a contradiction in one of the most popular transition arguments. It states that the transition will ensure abundant and affordable energy for everyone. However, the current state of the world is proof enough this is wishful thinking at best: the facts suggest that energy abundance lies with the energy sources the transition wants to do away with and replace.\nThat is how the developing world increases overall global oil demand while the developed world tries to consume less of it and mostly fails. And that is why BP has forecast continued dominance for oil\u2014and gas\u2014over the long term, with the decline mostly the result of improving energy efficiency, per its outlook. Interestingly, under its Current Trajectory scenario, strong oil demand remains despite a twofold increase in wind and solar deployments by 2050, to give those two, along with geothermal and biogas, a share of about 25% in total primary energy by that year.\nThis suggests that the current trajectory of energy policies, which has seen a veritable surge in wind and solar deployments, EV sales, and all sorts of other transition-related activities, is falling hopelessly behind the targets of the net-zero plan. It is something many transition advocates have been warning about, the IEA being among the most vocal ones. If the transition to net zero is to happen, the world needs to move faster, harder, and with even more urgency.\nYet this is not how things are moving on. There is that gap between the wealthy developed world, which is getting less wealthy as it directs ever-growing cash flows to the transition, and the poor developing world, which is getting wealthier because it is consuming more and more hydrocarbon energy\u2014and it likes it. That\u2019s how oil and gas will continue to dominate the global energy landscape in the future.

The company anticipates a $3-billion (\u00a32.3 billion) hit due to reduced demand for fuels, which has affected its refining business.\nBP has warned investors of significantly lower realized refining margins, which could slash its earnings by $500-$700 million for the quarter. This decline is attributed to weak diesel prices and narrower North American heavy crude oil differentials, which have particularly impacted BP\u2019s large refinery in Whiting, IN. Despite a high level of refinery maintenance in the quarter, the resumption of operations at the Whiting refinery is expected to provide an earnings uplift of $500 million.\nAdding to its financial challenges, BP plans to take a $2-billion write-down as it scales back its refining operations at the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany. The company aims to reduce operations by a third starting next year in response to weaker demand. This strategic move underscores BP\u2019s efforts to streamline its operations amid a challenging market environment.\nDespite these setbacks, investors expect BP's second-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, which the company defines as net income, to reach $3.13 billion, according to LSEG data. Earlier this year, BP implemented a hiring freeze and paused renewable energy projects as part of CEO Murray Auchincloss\u2019 plan to enhance returns and cut costs by $2 billion.\nBP\u2019s upstream production in the second quarter is projected to remain broadly flat compared with the prior three months, with oil and gas production standing at 2.38 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in the first quarter. This stability follows the start-up of fields in Azerbaijan and the United States. Additionally, higher realized oil prices in the second quarter are expected to boost profits by $100-$300 million.\nBP is not alone in facing challenges. The British oil and gas multinational Shell plc SHEL is also expected to take an impairment charge of up to $2 billion in its upcoming results. This follows Shell's decision to halt work on Europe\u2019s largest sustainable aviation fuel project in Rotterdam and sell off a refinery in Singapore. Shell plans to shift its focus from low-carbon investments to expanding its gas business, with plans to develop a gas field east of Trinidad and Tobago.\nAs BP prepares to release its second-quarter results, the company is navigating a complex landscape of lower refining margins, strategic operational adjustments and efforts to enhance profitability. While the anticipated financial hit is significant, BP\u2019s measures to cut costs and adjust its operational focus highlight its strategic response to current market conditions.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nBP currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like SM Energy Company SM and The Williams Companies, Inc.

Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, made the following comment on the situation:\n\"While we are seeing some tentative signs of cooling in the labor market, service sector inflation remains persistently high and it is likely the MPC would want to wait until the next set of forecasts and a few more data points before it embarks on its first rate cut.\"\nOverall, UK inflation is expected to remain slightly above the BoE\u2019s target of 2.0% in every quarter until at least the end of 2025, according to the poll. Median forecasts indicated that inflation would average 2.5% this year and 2.2% next year.\nAfter reaching new highs in 2024, the FTSE 100 may attract more investors, particularly those focused on income accumulation. The projected dividend yield of 3.8% for 2024 and 4.1% for 2025 is appealing, especially since these yields surpass the current inflation rate. Analysts predict that the ten largest dividend-paying companies in the UK will return \u00a343.9 billion to shareholders, accounting for 55% of the total dividends from the FTSE 100. The top 20 companies are expected to contribute \u00a357.4 billion, making up 72% of the total dividends.\nIn 2023, UK dividend growth of 5.4% aligned with the global average, according to a report by Janus Henderson. This increase was driven by substantial dividend increases from banks and oil producers, although it was tempered by lower payouts from mining companies. The report further mentioned that annual dividends in the UK grew to $86 billion in 2023 from over $63 billion in 2020.\nWhile investors gravitate toward American dividend stocks, some of the best FTSE dividend stocks also offer similar investment opportunities.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we scanned through the list of FTSE stocks and picked dividend stocks from the list.

The British multinational oil industry company reported growth in its net debt to $24 billion in the first quarter of 2024, from $21.2 billion in the prior-year period. Its debt-to-capitalization also grew to 22% from 19.6%. Due to this, S&P Global downgraded the stock's credit outlook to stable from positive. The company's CEO has devised a solution to address its debt by proposing to allocate 80% of excess cash toward dividends and share buybacks. Moreover, the company has announced $1.75 billion in share buybacks. Though this could be good news for income investors, S&P stated that this approach is unlikely to reduce debt, contrary to their previous expectations, despite the current favorable market conditions. The company is trying to improve its cash position as it generated over $5 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter.\nThat said, Citigroup stated that BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is surpassing most of its oil peers in the oil and gas industry. They believe that the company is perceived as a potential leader in Europe's new energy landscape, particularly after right-wing parties demonstrated significant influence in the recent European Union elections.

(NYSE:BP)'s adoption of modern technology is evident in its electric vehicle charging division, which is actively seeking to acquire Tesla's supercharging stations across the US. In addition to the infrastructure, BP has committed $1 billion to expand its EV charging network, including hiring the personnel associated with these sites.\nBP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) has a forward P/E of 7.43, which appears low, considering analysts' projections of a 10% annual growth in the company's EPS until the end of 2026.

It currently pays an interim dividend of $0.4362 per ADS and its stock has a dividend yield of 4.88%.\nBP p.l.c.

Might Have The Makings Of A Multi-Bagger", "Summary": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in BP's (LON:BP.) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on BP is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.10 = US$20b \u00f7 (US$275b - US$82b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nTherefore, BP has an ROCE of 10%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%.\nSee our latest analysis for BP\nroce\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for BP compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for BP .\nThe Trend Of ROCE\nBP is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 33% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.\nThe Bottom Line On BP's ROCE\nTo bring it all together, BP has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has only returned 16% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.\nOn a separate note, we've found 2 warning signs for BP you'll probably want to know about.\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

The company sold its entire stake in the Cherne and Bagre fields, located in the shallow waters of Brazil\u2019s Campos basin, to Perenco Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s do Brasil Ltda for $10 million.

Alongside its first-quarter results announcement, BP stated that since the second quarter of 2020, it has realized $18.2 billion in divestment and other proceeds.

The decision marks a stark change in direction for the British energy giant, which looked to pivot to renewables under its previous CEO, Bernard Looney.\nBP\u2019s move into green energy, although welcomed by a large proportion of shareholders, has pulled down the value of shares over recent months.

The company also announced a $1.5bn share buyback programme. Auchincloss will now prioritise the acquisition of new oil and gas assets, with a focus on the Gulf of Mexico and US onshore shale basins, especially where bp has existing operations, company sources told Reuters, with multiple other UK news outlets also reporting the move.\nThey added that bp will also invest in biofuels and low-carbon businesses that can generate cash quickly. Earlier this week, it purchased Bunge, a biofuels producer in Brazil, out of a joint venture for $1.4bn (\u00a31.11bn).\nBP\u2019s acquisition is expected to meet the company\u2019s bioenergy return threshold of over 15% and fits within its financial framework, including capital expenditure targets of around $16bn for both 2024 and 2025.\nEarlier this month, John Browne, the former head of bp, backed a Labour Party pledge to end North Sea oil and gas exploration, saying that plans for the region and the \u201cenergy transition\u201d would be important issues at the next election.\nBrowne said the next government should \u201ccall a halt\u201d to new North Sea oil and gas projects.

The deal is expected to lead to the consolidation of 100% of the JV's financial results, including debt of around $0.5 billion and lease obligations of approximately $0.7 billion.\n\nOnce the transaction is completed, BP will have the capacity to produce around 50,000 barrels of ethanol equivalent per day from sugarcane, utilizing BP Bunge Bioenergia's 11 agro-industrial units spread across five Brazilian states. This integrated business model spans the entire production chain, from cultivation to selling ethanol and sugar. (BP to Acquire Full Control of Biofuels Joint Venture for $1.4B)\n\n2.    Larger rival Shell has finalized a deal to acquire Pavilion Energy, the Singaporean liquified natural gas (LNG) firm, from Temasek, a global investment company. The acquisition is likely to strengthen Shell\u2019s overall LNG portfolio and allow the energy major to tap into the key gas markets in Europe and Singapore. Shell is aggressively pursuing an expansion strategy to solidify its position as a leader in LNG markets.\n\nThe purchase will be covered within Shell\u2019s present cash capital guidance. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has stated that its cash capital guidance will remain unchanged, which implies that it will not need to increase its planned spending to complete the purchase. The deal exceeds Shell\u2019s internal rate of return (IRR) hurdle rate for its Integrated Gas business, aligning with its growth ambition target of a 15-25% increase in purchased LNG volumes from the 2022 level.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe acquisition is scheduled to be closed by the first quarter of 2025, contingent upon regulatory approvals, following which Shell will start integrating the asset portfolios. The deal with Temasek should help Shell expand its LNG portfolio and meet its long-term objective of growing its LNG business by 20-30% within 2030 (compared to 2022).

ExxonMobil\u2019s ongoing arbitration over its right of first refusal concerning Hess Corporation\u2019s Guyana operations has put a significant hold on Chevron\u2019s $53-billion acquisition of Hess.\n\nThis delay has stalled a decision on whether ExxonMobil has a right of first refusal over Hess\u2019 lucrative Guyana operations. The arbitration panel, tasked with deciding this critical issue, remains incomplete three months after the case was filed, hindering any immediate resolution.\n\nThe sale has become a contentious issue, primarily because it involves a 30% stake in a lucrative Guyana oil consortium, which has discovered at least 11 billion barrels of oil and expects to produce 1.3 million barrels per day by 2027. ExxonMobil, holding a 45% majority stake in the consortium, claims that Chevron's acquisition of Hess circumvents its preemption right as specified in the joint operating agreement (JOA).

Cheniere Energy, a leading U.S. exporter of liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d), has announced a significant enhancement to its capital allocation strategy. The company has approved an additional $4 billion in share repurchase authorization through 2027 and plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 15% to an annualized rate of $2.00 per common share starting in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nCheniere\u2019s 20/20 Vision capital allocation plan, introduced in 2022, has made substantial progress. The plan aims to deploy over $20 billion toward growth, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.\n\nThe increased share repurchase authorization and dividend hike are part of a broader strategy to enhance shareholder value while supporting accretive growth projects. Further, Cheniere aims to consistently generate over $20 per share in distributable cash flow, leveraging its strategic investments and strong market position.

Oilfield service provider Oceaneering International's Manufactured Products division has secured a major contract from a U.S. independent energy company. The contract is valued at roughly $50 million and involves supplying a specialized underwater cable for a project in the Gulf of Mexico. This deal highlights OII's strong reputation in the industry and its capacity to deliver high-quality products in a timely manner.\n\nThe contract involves the supply of an electro-hydraulic, steel tube dynamic umbilical. This specialized product will be utilized in a project located in the Gulf of Mexico. The total length of the umbilical is approximately 27 kilometers (17 miles). Such a substantial length indicates the scale and complexity of the project, highlighting OII's technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nSecuring this contract is a notable milestone for OII. The anticipated revenues from this contract, approximately $50 million, should significantly boost the company's financial performance. This influx of revenues is expected to enhance OII's market position, providing a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and competitive energy sector.

However, the sector tracker has increased 7.7% over the past six months.\nWhat\u2019s Next in the Energy World?\nAs usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. government\u2019s statistics on oil and natural gas \u2014 one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly \u2014 will be on energy traders' radar. Fuel demand and the rate of stock drawdowns in the coming weeks will determine the trend in commodity prices. Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed, too.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This strategic acquisition, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, marks a pivotal step in BP's efforts to expand and optimize its bioenergy portfolio.\nStrengthening Biofuels Operations\nThe acquisition will allow BP to fully integrate BP Bunge Bioenergia into its operations, leveraging its trading and technology capabilities to maximize value. The deal is expected to lead to the consolidation of 100% of the JV's financial results, including debt of around $0.5 billion and lease obligations of approximately $0.7 billion.\nOnce the transaction is completed, BP will have the capacity to produce around 50,000 barrels of ethanol equivalent per day from sugarcane, utilizing BP Bunge Bioenergia's 11 agro-industrial units spread across five Brazilian states. This integrated business model spans the entire production chain, from cultivation to selling ethanol and sugar.\nEmma Delaney, BP\u2019s executive vice president for customers and products, conveyed her excitement about BP Bunge Bioenergia's industry leadership and opportunity to enhance value through its trading and technology capabilities.\nRefocusing Biofuels Development\nAlongside this acquisition, BP is reassessing its approach to new biofuel projects. The company is pausing two potential developments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel while continuing to evaluate three other projects. This strategic shift aligns with BP's goal to simplify its portfolio and focus on high-value, high-return initiatives.\nDelaney elaborated on this strategy, emphasizing that its focus on developing new biofuel projects has been motivated by maximizing value. These adjustments are aimed at achieving anticipated growth and returns from biofuels in a streamlined and targeted manner.\nFinancial and Operational Impact\nThis acquisition meets BP\u2019s expected returns threshold for bioenergy, aiming for more than a 15% return and fitting within its disciplined financial framework. BP plans to allocate around $16 billion in capital expenditures for both 2024 and 2025. This move supports BP\u2019s strategic bioenergy growth targets, contributing to approximately $2 billion in EBITDA from bioenergy by 2025.\nFuture Growth Prospects\nBP\u2019s full ownership of BP Bunge Bioenergia opens up new growth opportunities in the region, including potential advancements in next-generation ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and biogas. The company remains committed to expanding its bioenergy business, with ambitious goals to increase biofuels production and biogas supply significantly by 2030.\nPending regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024.

(BP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know", "Summary": "BP (BP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this oil and gas company have returned -3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which BP belongs, has lost 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, BP is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share, indicating a change of +37.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.51 indicates a change of +14.9% from what BP is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for BP.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for BP _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of BP, the consensus sales estimate of $63.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +27.9%. The $241.74 billion and $258.17 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.5% and +6.8%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBP reported revenues of $49.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.3%. EPS of $0.97 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -19.12%. The EPS surprise was -5.83%.\nThe company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBP is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about BP. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Madison Dividend Income Fund, in its first quarter report, said that it believes dividend stocks will rebound amid a broader sector leadership change in the market observed during the quarter, with Energy, Industrials and Financials pocketing significant gains. The valuation of dividend stocks is another reason behind the fund's optimism, as it cited data from Bank of America (BofA) Global Research, which says some dividend funds are \"historically cheap\" compared with the S&P 500.\nMany other notable Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend stocks in the current volatile environment. Talking to CNBC in April, JoAnne Feeney, Partner and Portfolio Manager at Advisors Capital Management, recommended investors to pile into \"good\" companies that pay dividends and keep their eyes \"firmly on the long run.\" The analyst thinks dividend stocks help investors navigate through cyclical volatility.\nIn this backdrop, let's examine some top high-yield dividend stocks that also have upside potential in terms of stock price. Based on the average target price set by Wall Street analysts, we preferred stocks with at least a 4% dividend yield and 20% upside potential.\nVale SA\nOne-Year Average Analyst Price Target: $15.74\nUpside Potential: 40%\nBrazilian metals and mining company Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) is one of the notable high-yield dividend stocks with upside potential. The stock\u2019s dividend yield touched 11% as of June 18 as Vale shares fell 28% so far this year, driven by volatility in iron ore and copper prices after fresh data from China raised concerns about economic recovery in the country. In May, UBS upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral and increased its price target to $15 from $13. UBS believes the ESG risks dragging down the stock are set to \"moderate\" as the firm believes the overall risk-reward for the company has also improved.\nWall Street analysts have an average price target of $15.74 for Vale, which presents a 40% upside potential from the stock price as of June 18.\nBP PLC\nOne-Year Average Analyst Price Target: $43.30\nUpside Potential: 22.35%\nBritish oil giant BP PLC (NYSE:BP) was in the news after Citi called the company a potential \"standard-bearer\" in Europe's future energy policy following European Union parliamentary elections which saw right-wing leaders gaining ground. BP has a dividend yield of about 4.9%. In May, BP reported weak Q1 results and expects upstream production in the second quarter to be slightly lower than in the first quarter.\nAccording to data from Yahoo Finance, Wall Street has a $43.30 price target on BP, which shows a 22.35% upside from the stock\u2019s current levels.\nKeyCorp\nOne-Year Average Analyst Price Target: $16.44\nUpside Potential: 21%\nWith a 6% yield and 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, Cleveland, Ohio-based banking company KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is one of the noteworthy high-yield dividend stocks with over 20% upside potential.\nWall Street analysts on average expect the stock to hit $16.44 over the next 12 months, which is about 21% higher than the stock price on June 18. In April, the regional bank posted first quarter results that came in weak amid rising expenses and a decline in net interest income. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.22, missing the $0.23 consensus.\nKeyCorp shares were trading at $13.59 as of June 18, while Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $16.44 on the stock, representing a 21% upside.\nRio Tinto\nOne-Year Average Analyst Price Target: $81.38\nUpside Potential: 23%\nMining giant Rio Tinto PLC ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) pays dividends semiannually and has a yield of over 6.5% as of June 18, one of the highest among peers in the mining industry. In April, the company said its iron-ore shipments fell 10% quarter-over-quarter. However, the company maintained its annual shipment guidance of 323 million to 338 million metric tons for the full year.\nWall Street analysts have an average price estimate of $81.38 for Rio Tinto, which represents a 23% upside from the stock\u2019s price as of the June 18 market close.\nUGI Corporation\nOne-Year Average Analyst Price Target: $30.67\nUpside Potential: 39%\nPennsylvania-based natural gas and power distribution company UGI Corp. (NYSE:UGI) has been paying dividends for the last 140 years and, as of 2023, increased its payouts for 36 consecutive years. The stock has a 6.7% dividend yield as of June 18. In the second quarter, the company\u2019s adjusted EPS came in at $1.97, beating estimates by $0.33, while revenue fell 20.3% year over year to $2.47 billion, missing the consensus by $600 million. The company affirmed its 2024 adjusted EPS outlook range of $2.70 to $3. Based on this EPS outlook, the company\u2019s payout ratio of under 50% makes the dividend safe.\nAccording to data compiled by Yahoo Finance, Wall Street analysts expect the stock price to reach about $31 over the next 12 months on average. This estimate represents a 39% upside from the current price.\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...
