This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 25, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.69 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.74% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CMS Energy?\nFor CMS Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that CMS Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that CMS Energy would post earnings of $0.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of +5.43%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nCMS Energy appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nNextEra Energy (NEE), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.93 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +5.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $7.27 billion, down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for NextEra has been revised 8.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.18%.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NextEra will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NEE): The Best Dividend Stock Now?", "Summary": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Stocks For Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend stocks.\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\nAlso read:\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\nCMS Energy and NextEra Energy are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that CMS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nCMS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.13, while NEE has a forward P/E of 20.86. We also note that CMS has a PEG ratio of 2.40. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.43.\nAnother notable valuation metric for CMS is its P/B ratio of 2.17. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 2.47.\nBased on these metrics and many more, CMS holds a Value grade of B, while NEE has a Value grade of D.\nCMS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NEE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CMS is the superior option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Many of them, however, find enough time to buy and sell stocks. And because many politicians demonstrate an uncanny ability to outperform the market, ordinary investors are keen to know the stock trades of senators and representatives.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, recently submitted regulatory filings that acknowledged six recent stock purchases in late June: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), Nestle (OTC: NSRGY), and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). Although the exact value of each transaction wasn't reported, all six trades were valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\nThe deets on Greene's newest holdings\nAlthough Greene didn't provide any commentary regarding the thinking behind her stock purchases, there are some clear reasons that could've motivated her decision making. Consistent with the market's overwhelming interest in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, two of Greene's recent picks have significant AI exposure. ASML manufactures equipment that semiconductor manufacturers require for making microchips. Encouraging news broke prior to Green's purchase that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing would be purchasing ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine earlier than expected. Providing sophisticated cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, CrowdStrike helps customers \u2014 with help from AI \u2014 protect various devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. The company recently reported strong results for its fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 30, including year-over-year diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) and free-cash-flow increases of 63% and 42%, respectively.\nStretching out to the world of retail apparel, Greene scooped up shares of activewear powerhouse Lululemon. Shares of Lululemon had plunged 33% from the start of the year to June 23, the day before Greene clicked the buy button. It's likely that the company's auspicious outlook for 2024 played a pivotal role in her decision-making. In its release of its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended April 28, management forecast top-line year-over-year growth of 11% to 12% for 2024, and diluted EPS to rise from 17% to 19%.\nWarehouse club superstar Costco also made its way onto Green's buy list. In early June, Costco reported sales in May had risen 6.4% compared to May 2023. And the growth didn't just occur for one month. The company also noted that revenue in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 had climbed 5.4% compared to the same period last year.\nEvidently, Greene also recognized a tasty opportunity with Nestle stock. Perhaps it was management's outlook for 2024 \u2014 guidance that it reaffirmed during a business update in April \u2014 that Greene found appetizing. In addition to organic sales rising 4%, management projected EPS growth between 6% and 10% for 2024. Or maybe it was Greene's hunger for passive income that was the source of motivation. Currently, Nestle stock offers a forward dividend yield of 3.1%.\nLastly, Greene chose to power her portfolio with NextEra Energy, a renewable energy powerhouse that performed exceptionally well in the first half of 2024. And while the company's future isn't guaranteed, a look at the company's past suggests that it has a history of growth \u2014 a trend that it can certainly extend in the future. Over the past 20 years, for example, NextEra Energy has achieved compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 9% and 8% for adjusted EPS and operating cash flow, respectively. During the same period, the company maintained focus on rewarding shareholders, hiking its dividend at a 10% CAGR.\nShould you make the same buys?\nAs savvy investors know, monitoring politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy. Rushing to copy the stock moves that politicians just made, however? Not so much. That being said, ASML and CrowdStrike are two excellent options for tech-focused investors who want to lean into AI and are certainly worth further investigation. Similarly, Lululemon and Costco are two premier consumer-focused companies that can bolster one's portfolio.\nNestle, on the other hand, has a history of underperforming the market, and it doesn't seem like there's a catalyst to change that in the near future. For those looking to supplement their passive income, moreover, there are much more compelling options than Nestle. NextEra Energy, for instance, is a compelling dividend stock and with it trading at 11.6 times operating cash flow, a discount to its five-year average cash-flow valuation of 15.8, today seems like an especially good time to take a close look at it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

Is It Still a Buy?", "Summary": "The utility sector is not exactly known for being a hot performer, but that didn't stop NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) from beating the S&P 500 index in the first six months of 2024. This impressive showing, however, needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, NextEra Energy is a well-run utility with a fast-growing business. But it should only be bought by a certain type of investor.\nA look at NextEra Energy's impressive first half\nIn the first six months of 2024, NextEra Energy's stock price gained roughly 16.5%. By comparison, the S&P 500 rose a slightly less impressive 14.5%. And the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLU) climbed just 7.5% or so. Clearly, NextEra Energy was a standout, including within the utility sector, which is important to take note of. It means that there was likely something more going on than a rising tide lifting all boats.\nNEE Total Return Level Chart\nSo what was driving NextEra higher? Pushing the performance examination back a little further to three years helps to highlight the key catalyst behind NextEra Energy's surprisingly strong showing in the first half of 2024. As the chart below highlights, NextEra Energy drastically underperformed both the S&P 500 index and the average utility stock thanks to a steep decline in 2023. In fact, even after the big six-month advance, NextEra Energy stock has basically gone nowhere for three years, while the average utility gained 9% and the S&P rose 28%.\nNEE Chart\nSimply put, NextEra Energy's outperformance in the first half of 2024 was really just a recovery from a steep drop. It could continue to outperform from here, but investors probably shouldn't go in expecting a repeat.\nNextEra Energy is well run and growing strongly\nTo be fair, NextEra Energy is a highly respected utility. Its business foundation is Florida Power & Light, one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Florida is an advantaged market, as it has benefited from in-migration for many years. That supports the company's requests for rate increases and capital spending plan approvals. On top of that foundation, NextEra Energy has built one of the world's largest renewable power companies, with a huge position in both solar and wind.\nOver the past decade, NextEra Energy has increased its dividend at a huge 10% annualized clip. That's an impressive figure for any company, but is truly astounding for a utility. That's what led to NextEra Energy being a Wall Street darling that was afforded a very rich price, as highlighted by a dividend yield that hovered around 1.75% between 2020 and 2022. That was dramatically below the yield on the average utility, as the chart below indicates.\nNEE Dividend Yield Chart\nThe deep share-price decline after interest rates increased reflected investors' worrying about all utilities. But it also reflected investors dumping one of the hottest stocks in the utility sector. It's not an uncommon event for the most highly valued stocks to see the steepest declines when Wall Street gets scared. At this point, using dividend yield as a rough gauge of valuation, NextEra Energy's valuation appears to be about middle of the road over the past decade. That said, it is again priced at a premium to the average utility, which suggests that further upside is probably limited.\nDividend growth investors should buy NextEra Energy\nImpressively, NextEra Energy is telling investors to expect earnings to rise between 6% and 8% per year through 2027, with dividend growth of 10% per year through 2026. So the core business story here hasn't changed. But investors have again given the stock a premium valuation, so the big recovery opportunity is likely gone. It wouldn't be a good idea to buy the shares expecting the second-half return to look as strong as the first-half showing. And yet dividend growth is likely to remain robust, which means that, all told, NextEra Energy is most appropriate for dividend growth investors. Those seeking attractive yields or value stocks will be better off elsewhere.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nCheck out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:\n11% = US$6.4b \u00f7 US$59b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.\nDoes NextEra Energy Have A Good ROE?\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, NextEra Energy has a higher ROE than the average (8.9%) in the Electric Utilities industry.\nroe\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy.\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\nNextEra Energy's Debt And Its 11% ROE\nNextEra Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.35. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\nSummary\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\nBut note: NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

I'd think every income investor would consider backing up the truck to load up on such an asset. Given that the average annual return on the stock is around 10%, even growth investors would have to consider buying in.\nThose levels of return are what NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) is currently offering investors. But don't get too excited. There's trouble in this ultra-high-yield paradise.\nThe NextEra Energy Partners' backstory\nIf you look at NextEra Energy Partners in isolation, you'll miss the most important piece of the master limited partnership's (MLP) story. That's because it serves a very specific purpose for its parent, utility giant NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). NextEra Energy basically created NextEra Energy Partners for the sole purpose of having an MLP buyer for its renewable power assets. In the industry, these sales are called \"drop downs.\"\nThe purpose of dropping down assets from NextEra Energy to NextEra Energy Partners is to raise capital at the parent level so NextEra Energy can continue to build more renewable power assets. These aren't one-sided transactions. NextEra Energy Partners taps the capital markets by selling units and issuing bonds so it can pay for the assets that are being dropped down. But in an ideal world, those assets will generate reliable cash flows that more than cover the financing costs, producing additional cash flow that can be distributed to unitholders.\nWhen everything works out as planned, this becomes a virtuous circle and everybody wins. NextEra Energy gets to grow its business using NextEra Energy Partners as a low-cost source of capital. And NextEra Energy Partners wins because its cash flows increase, allowing it to pay growing distributions.\nThat's the dream, anyway. Things haven't been working out quite as planned lately.\nThe big problem facing NextEra Energy Partners\nIn the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners generated $164 million in distributable cash flow, up from $156 million in the same quarter of 2023. Cash flow growth is good, of course -- but it also paid out $188 million in distributions in Q1, up from $169 million a year ago. That means it is paying out more than it can afford right now, and did a year ago as well. Nor were those quarters one-off cyclical occurrences. For the full year of 2023, the MLP produced $689 million in distributable cash flow but distributed $741 million.\nTo be fair, MLPs can pay out more than their distributable cash flows for short periods of time. That often happens when they have investments in their pipelines that will eventually generate enough cash flow to close the gap. So, in and of itself, this disparity isn't a death knell for NextEra Energy Partners.\nBut there's one other worry. Because investors are downbeat on clean energy and interest rates have risen, NextEra Energy Partners' cost of capital has increased.\nNEP Chart\nFor example, it just issued a note with a 7.5% coupon so it could pay off a note with a 4.25% coupon. If it chose to raise funds by selling units, that would mean having to support the dividends on those units at more than 13%. With financing costs on the rise, dropping assets down from NextEra Energy to NextEra Energy Partners is not quite as compelling a transaction as it was. This isn't the first time a controlled MLP has faced a dilemma like this -- this exact situation occurred in the pipeline sector a few years ago. Many parent companies resolved those difficulties by buying back their MLP children, often at attractive valuations for the parent.\nBe careful with NextEra Energy Partners\nNextEra Energy Partners still has big plans, but those plans are likely to get harder and harder to achieve given the increasingly high cost of capital it faces. The price of its units has fallen 70% from its peak, and they now trade more than 15% below where they were when NextEra Energy created the MLP. Unless there's a dramatic decline in the financing costs that NextEra Energy Partners faces, it is very possible that NextEra Energy will buy back NextEra Energy Partners in the next five years because the MLP just isn't as useful as it was. If that happens, the MLP's investors will likely end up owning shares of NextEra Energy, which has a dividend yield of just 2.8%.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy Partners wasn\u2019t one of them.

Given the election uncertainty and growing macroeconomic concerns, it will be hard for the market to repeat that performance in the second half.\nMany dividend stocks enjoyed even stronger first-half returns, including NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). While they'll likely face similar second-half headwinds as the broader market, they stand out to a few Fool.com contributors because they could deliver an encore performance in the second half.\nNextEra Energy rebounded in the first half\nReuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): Although NextEra Energy is a utility, it somehow managed to provide investors with a total return of just over 18% in the first half of 2024. That soundly beats the S&P 500 index's total return of roughly 15%. That said, NextEra Energy's price performance really represents a bounce back after rising interest rates led to a steep price decline. So investors probably shouldn't go in here thinking that a utility stock is going to shoot to the Moon.\nAnd yet there's something unique about NextEra Energy that will still attract investors: dividend growth. Over the past decade, the company's dividend growth has averaged around 10% a year. That's a good number for any company, let alone a utility. But here's the thing -- management is calling for dividend growth of 10% through at least 2026, backed by annual earnings growth of between 6% and 8% through 2027. So in this way NextEra Energy should be just as rewarding in the future for dividend growth investors as it has been in the past.\nThe key to the story is that Wall Street knows NextEra Energy is a dividend growth stock. It prices the shares accordingly, usually at a premium to other utilities. But so long as the dividend keeps growing at a rapid clip, the shares are likely to remain strong performers. The price drop that occurred when rates rose was based on the fear that dividend growth would be curtailed. Since that's not the case, it's reasonable to expect this dividend growth machine to keep on chugging along.\nLots of momentum heading into 2025\nMatt DiLallo (Targa Resources): Shares of Targa Resources rocketed in the year's first half, surging 48.2%. That crushed the S&P 500's 14.5% gain over the first six months of 2024.\nSeveral factors fueled Targa's big move. The pipeline company reported record adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the first quarter, driven by record volumes in the Permian and for liquefied petroleum gas exports. Its growing earnings and free cash flow gave the company the fuel to return more cash to investors. It announced a monster 50% dividend increase in the first quarter. The company also repurchased $124 million of its stock in the period.\nTarga still has a lot more growth coming down the pipeline. The company completed a new expansion project in May. It also secured two more projects, which it expects to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2026. They will add to the backlog of projects the company expects to complete in the coming months. Those expansions should continue driving its earnings and cash flow higher over the next few years.\nThe midstream company is about to hit a major inflection point. Targa Resources expects its total capital spending to decline from a range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion this year to around $1.4 billion in 2025 as its current wave of capital projects enter service. That will supply it with about $1 billion of incremental free cash flow next year. The company could use that excess cash to buy back more shares and continue boosting its dividend.\nWith momentum building for 2025, Targa could continue to deliver market-crushing returns in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\nThis oil giant keeps growing\nNeha Chamaria (ExxonMobil): After ending 2023 with barely 2% gains, ExxonMobil stock surged 15% in the first half of 2024, mirroring S&P 500 index gains. Rising crude oil prices, a big acquisition, and strong growth projections propelled shares of the oil and gas giant higher in recent months. ExxonMobil stock rose the most during the first few months of 2024 and hit all-time highs in April, also a period when crude oil prices rebounded sharply.\nEarlier in the year, ExxonMobil delivered industry-leading earnings of $36 billion and as much in free cash flow for 2023. It distributed $32.4 billion among its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, with 2023 also marking ExxonMobil's 41st year of consecutive dividend increases.\nExxonMobil's 2023 earnings, however, were lower compared with 2022, and that trend continued into the first quarter, with its Q1 earnings dropping nearly 28% year over year. That partly explains why the oil stock has cooled down a bit since late April, but investors overall remain focused on ExxonMobil's growth prospects.\nThe oil giant took a massive growth leap in May by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock deal worth $64.5 billion. The acquisition more than doubles ExxonMobil's footprint in the Permian Basin and is expected to be immediately accretive to its earnings and cash flows. Those higher earnings and cash flows should start reflecting in ExxonMobil's upcoming quarterly numbers and help the stock maintain momentum for the rest of the year.\nExxonMobil's stock, in fact, should keep humming beyond 2024 given management's expectation to more than double its earnings potential and nearly double its cash flows by 2027 versus 2019 at a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, that doesn't mean they don't decline during market sell-offs. While some may not fall as much as the major indexes, corrections tend to be widespread.\nThe good news is that market sell-offs are often opportunities to scoop up high-quality dividend stocks with even higher dividend yields because they move in the opposite direction of stock prices. Given those circumstances, it makes sense to have a watch list of top dividend stocks you want to buy during market sell-offs. Three that should top any list are NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). They could deliver supercharged income and total returns following a sell-off.\nA powerful dividend growth stock\nNextEra Energy has delivered superb dividend growth over the years. The leading clean energy-focused utility has increased its payout at a roughly 10% compound annual rate over the last 20 years. It has also delivered healthy compound annual earnings (9%) and operating cash flow (8%) growth over the past two decades. Those catalysts have helped power market-crushing total returns (over 1,700% for NextEra compared to about 600% for the S&P 500).\nThe utility currently offers an attractive dividend yield of around 2.8%. That's more than double the S&P 500's dividend yield (1.3%). A market sell-off would likely push that yield even higher.\nNextEra Energy expects to boost its high-yielding dividend by around 10% annually through at least 2026. This shouldn't be hard to achieve; the company has a low dividend payout ratio for a utility (59% compared to a peer average of 65%) and expects to increase its adjusted earnings at or near the top end of its annual target range of 6% to 8% per share through at least 2027. Meanwhile, given the accelerating demand for renewable energy, it should have plenty of fuel to continue expanding at a healthy rate in the future.\nIncome and rapid growth\nBrookfield Infrastructure has done a terrific job adding shareholder value over the years. The global infrastructure giant has increased its funds from operations (FFO) per share at a 15% compound annual rate since 2009 while lifting its dividend at a 9% compound annual rate. The company has benefited from strong organic growth drivers and acquisitions.\nBrookfield currently offers a 4.5% dividend yield. That high yield is mainly due to its dirt cheap valuation. It aims to raise that payout by 5% to 9% annually over the long term.\nThe company should have no problem achieving that goal. It expects a trio of organic drivers (inflation-linked rate increases, rising volume as the global economy expands, and capital project completions) to increase its FFO by 6% to 9% per year. Meanwhile, it anticipates that accretive acquisitions will boost its growth rate above 10% annually.\nAdd that to its already attractive dividend yield, and Brookfield should have the fuel to generate robust total returns from here. They'd likely be even higher for those who buy shares during a market sell-off.\nA high-octane income stream\nEnbridge also has a tremendous record of increasing its dividend. The Canadian utility and pipeline company has raised its payout for 29 straight years. It currently offers a monster yield of around 7.5%.\nEnbridge might not be growing very fast these days. However, it's still expanding at a decent rate. It expects its cash flow per share to rise at a 3% annual rate through 2026 and 5% annually after that. That cash flow will allow it to continue raising its dividend.\nSeveral factors fuel that growth forecast. Enbridge has a massive pipeline of secured capital projects that it expects to compete over the next several years. It should also benefit from cost savings from its increasing scale and inflation-linked rate escalators. On top of that, the company has excess investment capacity it can deploy into accretive acquisitions.\nGiven its already high yield, Enbridge's modest growth rate should still give it the fuel to deliver total returns above 10% annually. Moreover, if shares fall during a sell-off, the returns from that point could be even higher.\nSupercharged return potential\nNextEra Energy, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are already in excellent positions to generate strong total returns in the future. They offer high-yielding income streams and healthy growth profiles. However, they may become even more attractive investment opportunities during a market sell-off because it would likely drive down their stock prices and boost their dividend yields. As a result, they should sit at the top of any income investor's watch list of high-quality dividend stocks to buy during a market downdraft.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

It is developing the \u201cTesla Bot,\u201d an AI-powered robot. Additionally, it has also rapidly expanded Tesla Energy. TSLA\u2019s energy division has seen rapid growth recently, making it an intriguing energy play for investors.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIn terms of quarterly revenue growth, TSLA has seen a reduction of -8.7% YoY, with a reduction of -55.1% in earnings YoY. The profit margin is sitting at 14.37%, with a lower operating margin of 5.50%. This reduction is drastic, but investors are bullish for multiple reasons, and this reduction is likely already priced in.\nTSLA has seen rapid growth in its valuation over the last few weeks; it is up over 50% over the last month, with investors being bullish on different concepts such as Robotaxi. However, it is important to note the impact of its energy segment, with Morgan Stanley increasing its price target for TSLA primarily based on the sector. This is for good reason; in Q2 2024, it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage, which is a record for the company, but pails in comparison to what is expected soon. This came as the company missed vehicle delivery targets, making it an important catalyst for investors to consider and weigh.\nExxon Mobile (XOM)\nExxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\nExxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) is a premier crude oil and natural gas explorer and extractor. While it is based in the U.S., it operates all over the world, with many of its investments being international. Earnings are coming on July 26th, and as analysts are expecting lower earnings, the stock has slipped over the last month.\nIt\u2019s currently trading at a price of $113+ and is up almost 1% over the last month. The company has reported troubling earnings lately, by missing estimates in three of the last four quarters. Quarterly revenue is down 3.5% over the last year, with earnings down 28.1% over the same period. This is due to volatility in global energy prices, with has significantly impacted the margins XOM has.\nHowever, there are reasons to be bullish, especially for the long run. Due to expectations sliding before earnings are released, a miss will already be priced in \u2013 to a certain extent. Additionally, a new director bought $2 million worth of XOM, which is a significant bullish move and carries a heavy impact. Additionally, investments in international locations for the purpose of oil/natural gas explorations indicate the company\u2019s commitment to increasing the stream of supply it has.\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nNextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a leading clean energy company specializing in renewable power generation, operating wind, solar, and natural gas facilities, and providing electricity through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light.\nNEE stock is currently trading at ~$75, with a market cap of about $154 billion.

NextEra\u2019s unit Florida Power & Light Company (\u201cFPL\u201d), including Gulf Power, has plans to invest $43.8 billion in the 2024-2028 time period. FPL's focus is on clean, efficient, modernized generation and a stronger and smarter grid. The improving economic condition of Florida is also boosting the company\u2019s prospects. FPL served 81,000 more customers in the fourth quarter than in the year-ago period.\n\nAnother unit of NextEra Energy, NextEra Energy Resources, continues to make long-term investments in clean energy assets. The company expects to be able to add 36.5-46.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewables in the 2024-2027 time frame to the generation portfolio via clean energy investments. NextEra Energy has plans to invest $18.3 billion in this segment in the 2024-2028 time period. NextEra Energy Resources has more than 21 GW in the backlog of signed contracts, which provides clear visibility into the ongoing expansion of clean power generation.\n\nNextEra Energy\u2019s unmatched scale, experience and technology lead to predictable, superior returns. Its combined utility and renewables assets create unmatched competitive advantages as U.S. power demand is expected to grow 38% over the next two decades. The increase in electricity demand is expected to come from big data centers and higher demand from Oil and Gas companies in the Permian Basin region.\nStorage Holds the Key to Clean Energy Transition\nLast month, NextEra Energy Resources and Entergy Corporation ETR agreed to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generation and energy storage projects.

With market volatility and ongoing uncertainty with interest rates, dividend-paying companies can add an extra layer of stability.\nAs we step into July 2024, the market presents a plethora of options to diversify your investment portfolio. When selecting dividend stocks, it\u2019s essential to consider the company\u2019s dividend yield and growth prospects. A dividend yield between 1-3% often indicates a company\u2019s financial health. However, the yield alone should not be the sole determinant. Understanding the company\u2019s earnings growth, free cash flow, and dividend growth is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the dividend payments.\nBy carefully selecting companies that meet these criteria, investors can be on their way to achieving financial freedom. Now, let\u2019s unpack the 3 best dividend stocks to buy in July 2024!\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nPerson holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a leading renewable energy and utility company headquartered in Juno Beach, Florida.

Moreover, NextEra Energy Resources is the world\u2019s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun. This segment operates energy storage facilities, an area that will see robust growth over the next decade.

This is a testament to its diversified business model, providing stable revenue and cash flow from operations. Furthermore, its business has never looked stronger after emerging from its pandemic slump in 2020.

THIS Technology Is the Future\u201d\nThe post The 3 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: July 2024 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/3-Best-Dividend-Stocks-Buy-114500212.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.0077649057, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}, {"Ticker": "NEE", "Time": "2024-07-06T09:43:00.000Z", "Headline": "3 Energy Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential", "Summary": "The global economy has been steadily transitioning to renewable energy over the years. The pace has quickened in recent years, powered by falling costs and government incentives. Demand for renewables could further accelerate in the future, fueled by a surging need for power by technology companies for cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nThese trends play right into the hands of leading renewable energy producers NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP), and Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A). It makes them great energy stocks to buy and hold for their long-term total return potential.\nA powerful wealth creator\nNextEra Energy has been a wealth-creating machine over the years. The leading U.S. utility has generated an 11.4% annualized total return over the last 15 years. That has outpaced other utilities (6.8% annualized total return) and the S&P 500 (10.5%).\nPowering its returns has been its steadily rising earnings and dividend. Its adjusted earnings per share have increased at a 9% compound annual rate over the last decade, while its dividend has grown at a 10% compound annual rate. NextEra has benefited from the steady growth in power demand from utility customers in Florida, its investments in renewable energy, and accretive acquisitions.\nThose catalysts should continue powering above-average growth. NextEra expects to increase its adjusted earnings per share at or near the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through at least 2027. Meanwhile, it expects to grow its dividend (which yields almost 3%) at a 10% annual rate through 2026.\nIts longer-term outlook is just as bright, given the immense need for renewable energy in the future. It expects new renewables and storage capacity additions to be three times more over the next seven years, compared to the past seven years.\nHigh-powered growth potential\nBrookfield Renewable has grown briskly over the years. The leading global renewable energy company delivered 12% compound annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share since 2016. Meanwhile, it has increased its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades.\nThe company should continue generating high-powered earnings and income growth. Brookfield Renewable expects a trio of organic drivers (inflation-indexed rate increases, margin enhancement activities, and its vast development pipeline) to power 7% to 12% annual FFO per share growth through 2028.\nMeanwhile, it expects accretive acquisitions to drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. The company recently agreed to acquire a European renewable energy developer with a large pipeline of projects in various stages of development. These growth drivers will give Brookfield plenty of power to achieve its aim of increasing its dividend (which yields around 5%) by 5% to 9% each year.\nAnother factor powering its view is its growing portfolio of sustainable solutions. Brookfield has built platforms in the carbon capture and storage, biofuel production, recycling, nuclear services, and solar panel manufacturing segments. These investments add to its long-term growth potential.\nHigh-end dividend growth ahead\nClearway Energy is one of the country's largest producers of renewable energy. It also has a portfolio of cleaner-burning natural gas power-generating facilities. These assets produce lots of stable cash flow, which Clearway pays out via a high-yielding dividend (recently approaching 6%).\nThe company expects to increase its payout toward the high end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. It has already secured and funded nearly all that growth. Clearway sold its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling the proceeds into higher-returning renewable energy investments. The company has committed to deploy or has line-of-sight on enough new investments to deliver on its dividend growth target.\nMeanwhile, Clearway has growing visibility into its ability to increase its dividend beyond 2026. It has been renewing contracts on its natural gas power plants at high-enough rates to support low-end dividend growth in 2027. In addition, it sees several opportunities to add battery storage to its existing wind and solar projects. On top of that, it has a strategic relationship with a leading renewable energy developer, which should continue providing it with new investment opportunities.\nPlugged into a powerful growth megatrend\nRenewable energy demand should continue growing briskly in the coming decades. That should enable NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable, and Clearway Energy to increase their earnings and dividends at healthy rates.\nThose growth drivers position these top energy stocks to generate strong total returns for investors over the long term. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold for long-term potential.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

The renewable energy stock slumped 18% in June, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, wiping out all of its gains through May and some. As of this writing, shares of NextEra Energy Partners are now down 13% this year amid fears of a dividend cut.\nAnalyst downgrades hit the renewable energy stock\nNextEra Energy Partners stock plunged in 2023 after the company blamed funding constraints amid high interest rates and slashed its dividend growth goal through 2026 by almost half to 5% to 8% per year with an annual target of 6%. Last month though, NextEra Energy Partners reaffirmed its dividend growth target, but investors and analysts are skeptical.\nBarclays analyst Christine Cho cut NextEra Energy Partners stock's price target to $25 a share from $32 per share in June in light of the company's upcoming debt maturities. If NextEra Energy Partners cannot raise more funds, Cho fears it may have to cut its dividend by as much as 45% to 75% to repay debt worth $3.7 billion maturing between 2026 and 2032.\nRBC Capital is the latest to ring the warning bells on NextEra Energy Partners, with analyst Shelby Tucker cutting the stock's price target to $30 per share from $38 a share. Tucker, too, is concerned about the renewable energy giant's upcoming debt repayments and expects the company's cash flows from wind repowerings to fall short. For those in the know, NextEra Energy Partners plans to repower its wind assets to boost cash flows in the coming years.\nWith several analysts warning about a potential dividend cut, investors have been quick to dump NextEra Energy Partners stock in recent weeks.\nWhat should you do with NextEra Energy Partners stock now?\nIn its 2023 annual report, NextEra Energy Partners revealed that it had a \"minimum\" of $1.3 billion, $700 million, and around $2 billion in long-term debt maturing annually in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. That's nearly $4 billion of debt repayment coming up in less than two years even as the company had cash and cash equivalents worth only $245 million as of March 31.\nIf these numbers are anything to go by, fears about NextEra Energy Partners' dividend growth aren't entirely unfounded. The company's projected dividend payout ratio of mid-90% through 2026 also leaves no room for error. However, with the stock's dividend yield hitting 13%, the worst may already be baked into the stock's price. The upside, though, could still be limited as investors tread with caution in the medium term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy Partners wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NEE) Right Now?", "Summary": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\nThe AI sector maintained its momentum unabated in the second quarter of 2024, with tech stocks continuing to lead the charge. Despite the Fed scaling back rate cut expectations from three to one at the quarter\u2019s outset, stocks surged to end in positive territory by quarter-end. This was buoyed by better-than-expected inflation numbers and strong first-quarter earnings. The broader market gained 3.48% in Q2 2024 and its 12-month returns came in at over 23.4%. Dividend stocks underperformed the broader market recently, but with tech giants now beginning to issue dividends, analysts are optimistic about dividend prospects this year. The recent addition of Alphabet to the dividend-paying group suggests that these mega-cap tech companies could increase their dividends gradually over time. However, analysts caution that current dividend yields from these stocks remain relatively modest.\nIn the current market environment, investors are keenly exploring opportunities to boost their income. Despite their low performance so far this year, dividends gain importance in this regard as they have historically been crucial in generating returns for investors over many decades. Since 1960, approximately 85% of the total cumulative return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced back to reinvested dividends and the compounding effect they offer.\nWhen we talk about the compounding effects of dividends, we refer to the advantages they provide, particularly when they grow consistently over time. This growth allows for larger dividend payouts which, when reinvested, can further accelerate the overall investment return through compounding. In addition to providing compounding effects, companies that raise their dividends have also historically outperformed the market and those companies that cut or don\u2019t pay dividends at all. According to data by Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, dividend growers and initiators have delivered a 9.62% return to shareholders from 1972 to 2018, compared with an 8.78% return of dividend payers. Dividend growers also outperformed dividend non-payers, who returned only 2.40% during this period. Read more about dividend growers in our article, Best Dividend Kings to Buy for Safe Dividend Growth.\nA company\u2019s past track record of growing dividends is often the best crystal ball for predicting future growth. A low payout ratio, which measures dividends against earnings, also signals potential for future dividend growth. High dividend yields can falter in tough times, precisely when investors rely on them most. Companies with a history of dividend growth demonstrate their resilience, continuing to increase dividends even in downturns. Currently, there is rising demand for companies that distribute dividends, driven by an aging US population, seeking additional sources of immediate income. According to a report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached $1.66 trillion in 2023, growing from $1.23 trillion in 2020. The banking sector achieved record-high dividends last year, accounting for half of the global dividend growth. This increase was largely facilitated by a higher interest rate environment, which allowed many banks to expand their profit margins. The firm expects global dividends to reach their all-time high of $1.72 trillion in 2024, which would show a 3.9% growth from 2023 on a headline basis.\nCompanies that consistently raise their dividends have strong business models and solid balance sheets. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks for dividend growth.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we scanned the list of Dividend Aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the first quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).\nA wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy.\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)\n5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.74%\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is another best dividend aristocrat stock on our list with 28 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. The renewable energy company owns Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), which is the largest electric utility in the US. It delivers clean, affordable, and reliable electricity to its 5.9 million customer accounts, serving over 12 million people throughout Florida. Approximately 70% of the company's operations are linked to FPL, which recently experienced its most significant quarterly customer growth in over 15 years, adding more than 100,000 new customers compared to the same period last year.\nIncreasing the customer base contributes significantly to growth by expanding the number of electricity consumers. Management has leveraged this strong foundation to establish one of the largest solar and wind power companies globally. According to analysts, the company is poised for continued expansion, with management aiming to more than double its capacity by the end of 2027. This will also contribute to its dividend growth in the future. Continued expectations indicate around 10% annual growth in dividends per share through at least 2026.\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) expects to benefit from rising electricity demand in the upcoming years. In one of his recent interviews, the company's CEO, John Ketchum, highlighted with investors that US power demand is expected to surge by 38% over the next two decades, marking a significant increase compared to the growth rate observed in the previous 20 years. The company foresees renewables and battery storage playing a crucial role in meeting this heightened demand. Currently, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) boasts a strong pipeline of 300 gigawatts in renewable energy and storage projects.\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) offers a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.95%, as of July 2. The company's five-year average dividend growth rate stands at 10.74%, which places it as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list.\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was a part of 72 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q1 2024, up from 65 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of more than $1.73 billion.\nOverall NEE ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold.

A company that joins the S&P 500 only does so after careful consideration by a committee that aims to ensure the index includes only the cream of the crop.\nBut even stocks in the S&P 500 aren't immune to adversity. Some S&P 500 companies are struggling even as the index sits near all-time highs. Some of these stocks are down from their former highs by as much as 43%.\nInstead of chasing what's hot, consider why these three struggling stocks made the S&P 500 in the first place. Their current struggles don't change the fact they are wonderful buy-and-hold candidates worth considering for your portfolio today.\n1. A strong play on artificial intelligence\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of the index's newest members; it was added to the S&P 500 just a few months ago. The company began in electronic components in the early 1990s, but its primary business today is building modular server systems for data centers. Companies without the know-how or desire to custom-build data centers can turn to Super Micro Computer for turnkey systems.\nDemand for artificial intelligence (AI) has corporations heavily investing in data centers, which helped accelerate Super Micro Computer's revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarters. The stock has been a winner, surging over 200% over the past year. However, shares have cooled and are now down 31% over potential concerns about how sustainable this growth is.\nWhile triple-digit growth won't last forever, the future remains bright. Experts anticipate sustained investments in data centers over the coming years, which should steadily boost Supermicro's business.\nSuper Micro Computer has noted it's taking market share, which underlines its strong reputation in the field. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by over 50% annually for the next three to five years. That makes the stock a potential bargain today at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 34.\n2. A legendary consumer staples name getting back on its feet\nMost consumers are familiar with Clorox (NYSE: CLX) and its various household products from brands like Clorox, Pine-Sol, Brita, Glad, Burt's Bees, and more. Consumers gravitate toward these products due to name recognition, and people routinely buy them. That makes Clorox a durable business that performs well in good and bad times.\nClorox's stock has been uncharacteristically volatile; shares are down over 40% from their highs, its steepest drop since the early 2000s.\nSo, what happened? First, the stock did very well during the pandemic due to increased demand for disinfectant products. Shares surged to over 40 times earnings, a very steep price for a consumer staples stock.\nThen, hackers breached Clorox last summer, disrupting the company's operations. The attack hit Clorox's supply chain, hurting the company's ability to process and fulfill orders. The breach was the catalyst that began the stock's reversion to a more reasonable price.\nClorox is getting back on its feet. Analysts anticipate revenue growth beginning next year and earnings growth of 10% annually for the next three to five years. While a P/E ratio of 40 was nonsensical, today's forward P/E of 23 makes the stock a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n3. A leader in renewable energy\nNextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is the world's largest producer of renewable energy and America's largest electric utility business. The company has benefited from broad growth of renewable energy in America over the past several decades. Renewable energy is still just over 20% of all electric power generated in the United States, leaving a lot of room to grow over the upcoming decades. The company is also a well-known dividend growth stock; management has raised the dividend for 30 consecutive years.\nEnergy and utility businesses require a lot of investment to build new capacity and maintain infrastructure, so NextEra relies heavily on borrowing money. Rising interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which is a headwind for NextEra's business and has cooled sentiment on the stock. Shares have fallen over 20% from their high, though they've already rebounded from as much as 40% down.\nShares are still reasonably priced at just over 20 times earnings, notably below its average P/E of 28 over the past decade. Investors can expect continued demand for renewable energy to fuel steady growth for NextEra, which has helped the stock outperform the S&P 500 for decades.

Higher interest rates are a big part of the story since utilities generally make heavy use of debt to fund their businesses. But the sector is home to a lot of reliable dividend stocks.\nYou might want to take a closer look at NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC), and Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) in July while Wall Street is still in a dour mood and yields in the sector are still lofty.\nNextEra Energy is a dividend growth machine\nNextEra Energy has increased its dividend annually for three decades and counting. That's a pretty compelling streak, but it isn't the best out there. In fact, there are a handful of utilities that have achieved Dividend King status. Where NextEra Energy stands out is dividend growth, with the trailing annualized dividend increase over the past decade at a huge 10% or so. That figure is 10% over the trailing three- and five-year periods, too. And management is projecting 10% dividend growth through at least 2026, so the streak of huge dividend growth isn't over yet.\nXLU Chart\n10% dividend growth is good for any company, and it's really good for a utility. How does NextEra achieve this? It has a slow and steadily growing regulated utility business on top of which it has built one of the largest renewable power businesses in the world. The latter business is the growth engine, and given the global shift toward cleaner energy sources, the runway for growth seems likely to be long.\nThe problem with NextEra Energy is that investors know just how well run the company is and have priced it accordingly. The yield is below average for a utility at 2.9%. But if you are a dividend growth investor, this is probably the utility stock you'll want to own.\nBrookfield Renewable is laser-focused on clean power\nIf you like the notion of investing in clean energy but are looking for more yield than NextEra Energy has to offer, you should consider Brookfield Renewable. This isn't technically a utility, but it owns clean energy assets around the world and deserves your attention given its huge 5% or 5.7% yield. Why are there two yields? Because there are two share options, one structured as a partnership and one as a traditional corporation.\nBoth Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Renewable Corporation represent the same entity. The only difference is in the demand among investors for each share type. The partnership is a bit more complicated in that it comes with a K-1 form that has to be dealt with come tax time. But it is not a master limited partnership, so it can still be owned in a tax-advantaged retirement account.\nIf you are trying to maximize your passive income stream, Brookfield Renewable Partners is a strong option. If you don't want to bother with the K-1, a 5% yield is still pretty attractive. Either way, you still get a globally diversified portfolio of clean energy assets.\nBut, more importantly, you get to invest alongside Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM), which oversees Brookfield Renewable. Brookfield Asset Management has decades of experience and is a well-respected infrastructure investor. You could do much worse than partnering with this company by adding high-yield Brookfield Renewable to your portfolio.\nDominion Energy is on the mend\nThe last option on this list is a turnaround story in the form of Dominion Energy. As just a simple regulated utility, it has gone through a major business overhaul over the past decade or so. The most recent review has resulted in large non-core assets being sold (including three regulated natural gas utilities) so that the company can pay down debt, lower its payout ratio, and focus on its reasonably well-positioned regulated electricity operations.\nThe dividend yield is currently around 5.4% today, but the dividend isn't going to grow until the payout ratio is in line with the industry average, which will probably take a few years. However, given the yield, investors are being paid well to wait. After that point, the dividend should grow in line with earnings, which the company believes can expand between 5% and 7% a year. Notably, Dominion operates in one of the fastest-growing data center markets in the world, which should help to spur demand for power in its region.\nThere's still time, but don't wait too long\nUtility stocks are largely out of favor today as Wall Street worries about the long-term effect of higher interest rates. While interest rates are a headwind, the sector will adjust to the change over time, just like it has during past rate change cycles. If you can stomach stepping in when others are fearful, buying now while the news is bad could lead to strong returns over the long term. And three good places to start in the utility space are NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable, and Dominion Energy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Brookfield Renewable right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Brookfield Renewable wasn\u2019t one of them.

In full disclosure, the idea that all energy sources will be sustainable might be a stretch. Nevertheless, the sector is booming and with rising investments, it\u2019s a good idea to consider the best renewable energy stocks.\nFundamentally, the narrative comes down to scientific realities. An overwhelming consensus of scientists agree that climate change is real. Further, earth is practically speaking the only planet that can sustain human life. We must be good stewards of our home. In order to promote zero-emission goals and other climate-forward initiatives, renewable infrastructure will be part of the discussion.\nSecond, due to innovations such as artificial intelligence, global energy demand has only increased. Because of this dilemma, green and sustainable energy infrastructure will almost be integrated into the broader discussion because of the need for greater supply. Combined with political and ideological winds favoring the movement, these best renewable energy stocks stand on fertile ground.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nPerson holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nFalling under the broader regulated electric utility sector, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) through its subsidiaries generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America. It generates said power through a variety of means, such as wind, solar, natural gas and nuclear. It also develops and operates long-term contracted assets.\nI can\u2019t say that NextEra is the most exciting idea among the best renewable energy stocks. However, it belongs on this list in part due to its storied status. In addition, it\u2019s a consistent financial performer. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average earnings per share of 81.3 cents. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 9.53%.\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), EPS came out to $3.66 on revenue of $27.13 billion. During the most recent quarter, the year-over-year growth rate in EPS and sales came out to 8.7% and down 14.7%, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2024, experts see 7.6% EPS expansion to $3.41. Revenue may dip 1% to $27.85 billion. Still, let\u2019s not ignore the forward annual dividend yield of 2.92%.\nOrmat Technologies (ORA)\nStorage tanks and pipelines of an Ormat Technologies (OAR) Geothermal Power Station in Wairakei, New Zealand.\nSource: riekephotos / Shutterstock.com\nOne of the most intriguing names among the best renewable energy stocks, Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA) specifically falls under the renewable utilities space. Primarily, the company specializes in the geothermal and recovered energy power business. It also features a energy storage business unit. The real long-term moneymaker could be the geothermal unit, though, which involves extracting practical power from the earth\u2019s core.\nA key advantage of geothermal infrastructure \u2013 aside from the earth producing effectively unlimited energy \u2013 is that it\u2019s largely out of sight, out of mind. That\u2019s unlike the ugly wind turbines that represent eyesores for surrounding neighborhoods. Geothermal is more of a speculative mechanism at the moment. Still, Ormat\u2019s financials are quite decent, producing an earnings surprise of nearly 22% in the past four quarters.\nIn the TTM period, Ormat generated EPS of $2.21 on revenue of $868.36 million. In the most recent quarter, it posted earnings and revenue expansion of 32.9% and 21%, respectively. For fiscal 2024, analysts see modest decline in EPS to $2.04. However, the top line could rise by 7.6% to $892.1 million.\nClearway Energy (CWEN)\nthe clearway energy (CWEN) logo on a web browser under a magnifying glass\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\nOne of the more speculative ideas among the best renewable energy stocks to buy, Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) is largely appropriate for those who want to take big swings at the plate. Falling under the renewable utilities ecosystem, Clearway features a mix of conventional and renewable energy generation projects. Mostly, the mix consists of wind, solar and natural gas.\nSince the start of the year, CWEN stock dropped more than 11% of equity value. In the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s down almost 16%, which hasn\u2019t provided much confidence for prospective investors. At the same time, there might be a case that Clearway is presently undervalued. Right now, shares trade at 2.19X trailing-year sales. Between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the average price-to-sales ratio landed at 2.42X.\nStill, it\u2019s a risky proposition. During the TTM period, Clearway\u2019s net income reached $77 million on revenue of $1.29 billion. However, the most recent quarterly sales growth was almost 9% down. Nevertheless, analysts rate CWEN a consensus strong buy with a $31 average price target. That implies almost 29% upside potential.\nFinally, a forward dividend yield of 6.81% just might entice market gamblers.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

THIS Technology Is the Future\u201d\nThe post The 3 Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy in July 2024 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/3-Best-Renewable-Energy-Stocks-100000299.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.161362946, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "NEE", "Time": "2024-07-02T14:00:00.000Z", "Headline": "5 Top Stocks to Buy in July", "Summary": "Now that we're officially halfway through 2024, it's time to reflect on where the stock market has been. Although no one knows what the market will do in the short term, we can try to filter out the noise and be aware of what's driving broader themes. A good place to start is by looking at sector performance.\nThere are 11 sectors in the S&P 500. And only two of them -- tech and communications -- are outperforming the index. Right off the bat, it tells you that growth-heavy sectors are doing well, and value and income stocks are lagging. Dig deeper, and you'll find that mega-cap growth, more so than smaller growth stocks, are driving the bulk of the gains in the major indexes.\nInvestors looking for buying opportunities outside of mega caps have come to the right place. Here's why these Motley Fool contributors are particularly excited about Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nPlease identify yourself\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Okta): It's a great time to get excited about Okta stock again. The software-as-a-service specialist, which sells cybersecurity and digital identity management services, is trading at about where it was at the beginning of the year. Yet its prospects are brightening.\nSales in the most recent quarter were up a healthy 19% to $617 million. Almost all of the revenue figures are subscription-based, too, which gives shareholders confidence that sales won't swing wildly during any upcoming industry slowdown.\nOkta is not profitable just yet, but that won't be true for long. Operating losses narrowed to 8% of sales last quarter from over 30% a year ago. Meanwhile, cash flow is solidly in positive territory, at nearly 40% of sales.\nAccording to its late May outlook, management is projecting a growth slowdown in the coming months, with second-quarter revenue gains decelerating to about 14%. Sales should rise by about 13% for the full fiscal year, too. But investors should look past that short-term volatility toward Okta's likely impressive earnings growth over the next several fiscal years.\nBuying the stock in July and patiently waiting for these benefits to accrue will put you in a great financial position when you reflect on your decision to buy this small but growing tech company.\nGet energized with Celsius\nAnders Bylund (Celsius Holdings): Known for its fitness-focused energy drinks, Celsius is brewing up impressive growth. Unlike archrivals Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) or Red Bull, Celsius focuses on providing a fitness-centric boost, with no artificial preservatives or flavors. It has proved to be a recipe for success, especially with the distribution expertise of Celsius partner PepsiCo.\nThe Pepsi deal is paying off big time, expanding Celsius' reach globally and boosting brand visibility. International growth is only getting started, leaving a ton of overseas opportunities to explore. The health-focused branding message should resonate just as strongly in valuable markets such as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.\nThe stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 61 times earnings and 9.4 times sales. But those valuation ratios are still a bargain compared to Celsius' loftier figures over the last couple of years. A 28.6% price drop in June took the edge off a skyrocketing stock chart, giving Celsius investors a chance to load up on shares at a lower price premium.\nThe heart of Celsius' idea is that its health-conscious growth story has many chapters left. The Pepsi partnership has proved effective, and the company is expanding its brand around the world. The stock isn't cheap, but it has earned every drop of that premium price tag. Those lofty ratios should calm down as it executes its profitable growth plans over the next few years.\nThere is room for a third global giant in the booming energy drink industry. Many have tried and failed to fill that role. With soaring sales and robust profit margins already under its belt, Celsius looks primed to get the job done. That's why its stock is a hot buy in July.\nAn attractive valuation, dividend, and business\nKeith Speights (Ares Capital): I have a condition I call investors' acrophobia. The higher the stock market goes, the more afraid I become. With the S&P 500 continuing to rise, my nervousness is increasing. But Ares Capital is the kind of stock I don't have qualms about in a pricey market.\nAres is a leading business development company (BDC). And its stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading at only 8.7 times forward earnings.\nThat attractive valuation isn't because the company's business is floundering. Its earnings continue to grow. CEO Kipp deVeer said in the first-quarter earnings press release, \"With our competitive advantages, we believe we are well positioned to build upon our nearly 20-year track record of generating attractive investment returns for our shareholders.\"\nThose competitive advantages include a stronger financial position and more investment professionals than its rivals have. Ares Capital has a longer history in the industry than most direct lenders. Unsurprisingly, the company has delivered significantly higher returns on equity (ROE) and total returns than other BDCs.\nIncome investors should love the forward dividend yield of over 9.3%. Even if you're not an income investor, this hefty yield gives Ares a head start on delivering exceptional returns.\nAre there risks associated with investing in a BDC that provides financing to middle-market businesses? Sure. However, Ares Capital has proved to be remarkably resilient, generating strong ROE during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and the pandemic period of 2020 and 2021.\nWhether or not you have investors' acrophobia, Ares Capital looks like a great stock to buy in July.\nAny drop in this stock's price is an opportunity to buy\nNeha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): I recommended NextEra Energy in May, and while the stock surged during the month, it has come under a bit of pressure over the past couple of weeks or so. I believe the fall was unwarranted, and with NextEra Energy reminding investors yet again about its growth potential and plans, I am picking it as my top stock to buy now.\nInvestors were spooked when management announced plans to sell equity units worth $2 billion in mid-June. What they might have overlooked, though, is the reason the company is raising money via a share sale: to fund growth.\nAt its latest Europe investor presentation, NextEra Energy quoted an industry report projecting fourfold power demand growth in the U.S. over the next couple of decades versus the previous 20 years. As the owner and operator of the largest utility in the U.S., Florida Power & Light, NextEra is primed to benefit from any surge in power demand.\nTo top that, the company is also the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a leader in battery storage. It announced plans to invest $65 billion to $70 billion over the next four years with a potential to develop 36.5 to 46.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable and storage capacity through 2027.\nThat brings us back to why the fall of NextEra Energy stock after the company announced an equity sale was an overreaction. With its utility and renewables businesses, it could spend around $100 billion between 2024 and 2027. But equity issues are expected to be only about 5% of the company's total projected spending. It expects to fund the bulk of its growth through cash generated from operations and will rely more on debt than equity to fund the remaining portion.\nWith NextEra Energy further reiterating its adjusted earnings-per-share growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2027 and increases in dividends of around 10% through 2026, I believe any drop in the stock's price is an opportunity to buy and hold for the long term.\nHome Depot knows how to navigate a cyclical slowdown\nDaniel Foelber (Home Depot): In the long term, stock market winners are companies that can grow earnings over time through innovation, staying flexible, and savvy acquisitions. But in the short term, the market is often driven by narratives.\nRight now, the market is marching higher to the beat of the mega-cap growth drum. But behind the scenes, many industry-leading consumer-facing companies like Home Depot have seen their stock prices get left behind. The home-improvement retailer's stock is down year to date and up less than 10% over the last three years compared to a 24.3% gain in the S&P 500.\nAt least part of the sell-off is justified. Home Depot and its peer Lowe's Companies are facing a difficult housing market. Management commentary hasn't shied away from its impact on results.\nHigh volume in home sales is great for Home Depot and Lowe's because homebuying coincides with home improvement. But if homebuying is low or so expensive that consumers have little left over for home improvement, then they might be less inclined to pair pricey projects with a home purchase.\nThe economic indicators point to relatively expensive housing, record-high credit card debt, and some of the highest mortgage interest rates in the last decade -- all bad news for Home Depot.\nDespite these challenges, the company has continued investing through the cycle with new store openings and expansions. On June 18, it completed its $18.3 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution -- which boosts its building products and roofing materials offerings. Management has been targeting professional contractors as a key growth area that can help diversify the business to be less dependent on consumer sales.\nOn the surface, this strategy looks fairly aggressive, considering all the near-term challenges. But the company has historically been an excellent capital allocator and has the balance sheet needed to take market share during a slowdown rather than be passive.\nHome Depot is also a reliable dividend stock. In February, it announced a 7.7% increase to its dividend, bringing it to $2.25 per share per quarter, or $9 per year. The dividend is up 379% over the last decade and 65% over the last five years. With a yield of 2.6%, it's an excellent dividend stock to buy for patient investors who believe in the company's ability to navigate cyclical ebbs and flows.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Okta right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Okta, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Okta wasn\u2019t one of them.

A potential cut to the company's 13.8% dividend could be in the cards.\nRBC forecasts a dividend cut for NextEra\nIn his note today, RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker lowered his rating on NextEra Partners from outperform to market perform, cutting his price target from $38 to $30.\nTucker now believes that there aren't enough lower-cost wind repowering opportunities to grow NextEra's earnings to its 5% to 8% target, and that the company may have trouble keeping the dividend this high while also paying off billions of looming convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) maturities. These types of project financings enabled NextEra to fund projects in a relatively low-cost and flexible manner, but NEP's CEPF notes were sold when interest rates were much lower. After 2026, there are $3.7 billion of looming maturities that will need to be paid off.\nWhile NextEra has time and options to pay off these liabilities, the increased cost of capital since the CEPFs were sold means that it will be expensive for NextEra to refinance. Thus, while management had contemplated private financings, Tucker thinks the lingering higher interest rate environment will necessitate a cut to the company's distribution. Tucker suspects a 50% cut could be in the cards, and may even be prudent. That would take care of the CEPF financing while leaving the company free from having to take on expensive debt or issue equity. Issuing equity would be painful, with the stock down 68% from its all-time highs.\nBe wary of MLPs that pay out high dividends\nInvestors may have been tempted to buy NextEra in the past due to its ample and growing dividend. But the problem with these MLP models is that when interest rate or economic worries pop up and the stock goes down, the company can no longer issue stock to grow. Thus, the model becomes \"stuck\" and can result in painful dilution or cuts to what once looked like a mouth-watering dividend yield.

(FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FLSR) has to be my top solar stock pick after ending the last trading session of the first half with a nearly 10% plunge. Indeed, the broader basket of renewable energy stocks was under pressure the day after the Trump-Biden presidential debate.\nGiven the generous subsidies his administration offered, solar companies would undoubtedly prefer if Joe Biden stayed in the Oval Office.\nDepending on who you ask, Biden had a tough showing against Trump in their first faceoff of 2024. Some Democrats may be seriously concerned about Biden\u2019s performance. Though Biden may have lost the debate, only time will tell who comes out on top come Election Day.\nAt this juncture, FSLR stock seems to be trading as though Trump has already won the election. Given that First Solar had been performing quite well prior to the slip, I view the dip as a great longer-term buying opportunity for solar investors.\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ)\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) logo on the mobile device. Canadian is a company that manufactures photovoltaic solar modules and provides ready-to-use solar power solutions.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) is a deeper value option for investors after nosediving more than 42% in the first half. Like other solar plays, CSIQ stock was under pressure during Friday\u2019s session, partly thanks to Biden\u2019s poor performance in the debate.\nWith a market cap south of $1 billion and freshly cut full-year sales guidance, Canadian Solar may seem more like a value trap than a bargain, especially given that its solar modules may not be the best-in-class in terms of efficiency right now.\nDespite not having the most sought-after solar panels, the firm offers an excellent value proposition. Its multi-crystalline silicon solar cells are no slouch, either, with an impressive 23.81% efficiency rating (a world record set in 2020).\nI consider CSIQ stock an excellent value play while going for 6.6 times forward P/E.\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nPerson holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) also took an uppercut to the chin on the last trading day of the first half, shedding 4%. With Trump\u2019s victory seemingly priced in, there could be considerable upside should Biden and the Democrats pull off a comeback. Either way, much election risk has been removed after the first debate.\nThe real value of NEE stock lies in its impressive long-term narrative. The company expects annual earnings to grow 6-8% through 2027. Additionally, its sheer size ($145.5 billion market cap) could provide it with the means to scale up as it looks to transition the world to cleaner energy.\nThough some notable analysts have downgraded NEE stock in recent weeks, I view the name as one of the best values in the renewable scene, even if it\u2019s not the biggest beneficiary of an AI-induced surge in power demand. The stock trades at 19.35 times trailing P/E with a 2.79% dividend yield, making it a great balance of income and long-term growth.\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

MCFT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Dominion Energy D, NextEra Energy NEE and FirstEnergy FE.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nVistra stock skyrocketed 125% in the first half of 2024, lagging only Super Micro Computer and Nvidia as the top-performing S&P 500 company.\nVistra is thriving as Wall Street embraces the companies that will power the U.S. as the country attempts to transition away from fossil fuels at the same time as the artificial intelligence boom sends energy demand soaring.\nVistra is the largest competitive power generator in the country and it's gone all in on nuclear and other alternative energy sources poised to power the world in the coming decades. VST's earnings and revenue growth outlook is impressive and its most recent EPS estimates showcase even stronger bottom-line expansion.\nOn top of that, Vistra's recent pullback sets investors up to buy VST stock at a great entry point.\nThe Energy Transition Megatrend\nAI grabbed the lion's share of the headlines so far this year. Yet three of the seven top-performing S&P 500 stocks in the first half of 2024 were new-age energy companies, including Vistra.\nWall Street giants like Goldman Sachs view the global energy transition as one of the most important pillars of the U.S. economy during the coming decades.\nAlternative energy accounts for roughly 80% of global energy investment growth, and the International Energy Agency estimates that $2 trillion will be spent on clean energy technologies and infrastructure in 2024 alone, across wind, solar, energy storage, nuclear, the electricity grid, and beyond.\nNuclear is rapidly gaining steam as part of the non-fossil fuel energy push as wealthy nations, tech giants, venture capitalists, and beyond finally realize its reliability and nearly boundless potential must be unleased. Microsoft and other firms have partnered directly with nuclear energy companies to fuel their AI-focused data center expansion.\nThe U.S. co-led in December 2023 a coalition of over 20 countries from four continents that pledged to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This effort is part of a huge push from the U.S. government to spur spending and investment across non-fossil fuel energy.\nVST 101\nVistra is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. VST's portfolio includes natural gas and coal, which remain vital, as well as nuclear, solar, and battery energy storage facilities.\nVST closed its acquisition of Energy Harbor in March to boost its zero-carbon generation portfolio. Vistra added a 4,000-megawatt nuclear generation fleet and roughly 1 million additional retail customers. The Energy Harbor deal transformed Vistra into one of the foremost integrated zero-carbon generation and retail electricity companies.\nVistra owns four nuclear generation facilities, generating enough zero-carbon baseload electricity to power 3.2 million U.S. homes. Vistra owns the second-largest competitive nuclear fleet and boasts the second-largest energy storage capacity in the country. This includes one of the world's largest battery energy storage facilities. Vistra is also actively expanding its portfolio of solar assets.\nVistra said last quarter that the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides the opportunity to \"realize material benefits with respect to its renewables and energy storage projects, as well as provide strong price support via the nuclear production tax credit for its nuclear facilities.\"\nVistra earlier this year started construction on two of its three larger Illinois combined solar and energy storage projects, as part of the state's Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative.\nGrowth Outlook and EPS Revisions\nThe Irving, Texas-based firm currently serves approximately 5 million residential, commercial, and industrial retail customers across 20 states, including every major competitive wholesale market.\nVistra is projected to grow its revenue by 15% in 2024 and another 11% next year to reach $18.85 billion in fiscal 2025.\nMore importantly, Vistra is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 10% this year and 36% next year, based on current Zacks estimates. The company's earnings revisions have surged over the past 12 months, with its FY24 consensus up 25% from where it was this time last year, while its FY25 estimate has climbed 34%.\nBetter still, Vistra's most accurate/recent EPS estimates came in way above consensus. VST's most accurate Zacks estimate for FY24 is 20% above the already greatly improved consensus at $4.74 a share vs. $3.95, with FY25's 17% higher. Vistra's surging earnings estimate revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nPerformance and Technical Levels\nVistra shares soared roughly 125% during the first six months of 2024, lagging only Super Micro Computer and Nvidia (NVDA) in the S&P 500. VST's performance also crushed fellow nuclear energy standout Constellation Energy's (CEG) 75%.\nVistra's market-crushing performance is part of a 275% run in the last two years and a 230% climb over the past 12 months, blowing away Nvidia's 205% and Constellation Energy's 125%.\nInvestors who missed this stretch can buy VST 20% below its late May peaks. VST is also trading 32% below its average Zacks price target. Vistra is attempting to hold its ground at its 50-day moving average while trading at its lowest RSI levels since the market bottomed in October.\nBottom Line\nVistra is poised to thrive as more of Wall Street grasps that VST and a few other key energy companies are set to benefit directly from soaring AI-based energy demand as the U.S. attempts to transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe momentum behind alternative, clean, and renewable energy is monumental and seemingly unstoppable. Vistra stock helps investors gain exposure to that key megatrend. Plus, Vistra pays a dividend and trades at a 35% discount to the Utilities sector and 37% below Constellation Energy with a PEG ratio of 1.06.\nBear of the Day:\nMasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. shares have tumbled 37% in the last year, including a 16% YTD drop. MasterCraft Boat is suffering from slowing demand and other setbacks after a booming post-Covid stretch.\nMCFT's earnings outlook has plummeted during the last 12 months, dropping meaningful lower following its Q3 FY24 release in early May.\nMasterCraft Boat Basics\nMasterCraft Boat is one of the powerhouses of the recreational boating world. The company is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats through its four brands: MasterCraft, Crest, Aviara, and Balise.\nMasterCraft Boat holds a leading market share in performance sport boats and pontoon boats, two of the fastest-growing segments of the powerboat industry. MasterCraft Boat is also expanding in the large, growing luxury day boat segment.\nMasterCraft Boat posted 28% revenue growth in its fiscal 2021 and 38% stronger sales in FY22. The company posted 3% sales expansion in FY23, as it came under pressure from those difficult to compete against periods.\nMasterCraft Boat benefitted from the Covid-based spending spree. But anyone who wanted to buy a boat over the last few years seemingly already did. Consumers are now spending heavily on travel and experiences. On top of that, the macroeconomic landscape is far different.\nMasterCraft Boat CEO Brad Nelson said last quarter that a \"competitor's largest dealer is in financial distress, which has heightened competitive pressure with the potential for higher-than-normal competitor discounting. Dealer inventories remain higher-than-optimal and inventory carrying costs are elevated. Consequently, dealers are taking a cautious approach to ordering ahead of the annual model year changeover.\"\nBottom Line\nMasterCraft Boat's recent setbacks are part of a long-term downtrend that's seen its consensus FY24 earnings estimate fall roughly 70% in the past 12 months, while its FY25 estimate is over 50% worse. MasterCraft Boat's overall downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.\nMasterCraft Boat shares are down 8% over the past five years vs. the S&P 500's 90% climb. MCFT is not alone in its struggles, with the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector down 20% during the last five years.\nMasterCraft Boat trades below its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. MCFT also trades at a 62% premium to its three-year median at 11.X forward 12-month earnings. Now might not be the best time to think about buying MasterCraft Boat.\nAdditional content:\nU.S. Utilities Prepare for Above-Average Hurricane Season\nThe Atlantic Hurricane season spans from Jun 1 to Nov 30 and brings severe storms, which impact the electric supply infrastructure of the utility companies. Nature's fury is unpredictable and to reduce the impact of severe weather conditions, utilities have invested millions of dollars in fortifying their infrastructure.\nFor 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an 85% chance of an above-normal hurricane season, with 17-25 named storms and eight to 13 hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes. This year's forecast is around 30% more storm activity compared to the number of storms predicted last year.\nThanks to the improvement in weather forecasts and technology, utilities can locate areas in their service territories that are historically prone to severe weather conditions. Utilities have been working on a multi-year infrastructure strategy to strengthen the electric grid, making it resilient enough to withstand the challenges posed by severe weather conditions.\nElectric utilities are burying outage-prone electric service lines, managing vegetation near power lines and installing smart equipment that can detect outages quickly and automatically take corrective actions. Utilities are also working to save essential equipment in flood-prone areas and strengthen the poles and wires that need to withstand the fury of nature.\nUtilities upgrade and strengthen electric infrastructure work throughout the year to improve their quality of service and provide service even during difficult weather conditions.\nUtilities Taking Initiatives\nMeasures taken by a few utilities to counter the hurricane season are mentioned below.\nDominion Energy has been investing steadily to upgrade its infrastructure. Dominion's unit Dominion Energy Virginia has completed burying 2,000 miles of overhead power lines, which is part of the company's Strategic Underground Program. The shifting of power lines underground will lower storm-related outages and reduce the time for restoration of power in outage-prone areas during the hurricane season.\nNextEra Energy has a comprehensive and flexible storm response plan. NextEra Energy unit Florida Power & Light Company has invested in a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid that benefits customers by improving the speed of restoration and reducing outage times following severe weather. The company has invested in a smart grid, buried power lines and replaced nearly all of its transmission structures with steel or concrete.\nFirstEnergy is also regularly making investments to strengthen its transmission and distribution network. The company is also using helicopters to inspect the transmission lines. The purpose of the inspections is to search for equipment issues that are not apparent from the ground and faults that are not visible from the ground. FirstEnergy also uses thermovision cameras to take infrared pictures of electrical equipment, assisting in the identification of possible issues in power lines.\nAll these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nPrice Performance\nEach of the stocks mentioned above has performed better than the industry in the past six months.\nRound Up\nWe require a 24X7 supply of electricity to smoothly continue our daily chores but the devastation caused by hurricanes can disrupt the power supply. Global warming has made these storms even more destructive. Yet, investors should note that utilities have been bracing their stocks against any upheaval that these storms might trigger.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.\nThe current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.\nInstead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.\nDominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.\nThus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.\nTo put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.\nLonger term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.\nCashing in on the summer's Sun\nMatt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.\nFPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).\nNextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.\nThe company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).\nDuke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns\nNeha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nDuke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.\nDuke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though -- it plans to invest a whopping $73 billion to expand and modernize its infrastructure through 2028 to grow its rate base steadily. The utility expects its investments to boost adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 7% through 2028, which should also support dividend growth.\nThe stock yields 4% today, and the utility believes it should be able to maintain its yield in the coming years. Overall, that makes Duke Energy a compelling stock to buy if you want to cash in on rising power demand.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NYSE:NEE) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 80%", "Summary": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in NextEra Energy implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\nAnalyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\nEvery investor in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NextEra Energy.\nSee our latest analysis for NextEra Energy\nownership-breakdown\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nNextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NextEra Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NextEra Energy. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 5.1% of the stock.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of NextEra Energy\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur information suggests that NextEra Energy, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$255m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in NextEra Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nNext Steps:\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with NextEra Energy (at least 1 which is concerning) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This partnership agreement should put CMS a step toward duly achieving its net-zero carbon emission goal by 2040.\nBenefits of the Agreement\nIn response to the United States\u2019 growing demand for clean electricity, utility providers such as CMS Energy are rapidly shifting their dependence from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources in order to reap the benefits of the growing utility-scale renewable energy market's financial, environmental, social and governance benefits. To this end, it is imperative to mention that as energy storage has emerged as a critical component of the clean energy market\u2019s expansion, utilities are targeting to expand their footprint in this space as well. The latest agreement seems to be one such initiative undertaken by CMS Energy.\n\nNotably, CMS Energy aims to spend $3.4 billion in clean energy between 2024 and 2028, which includes the deployment of energy storage, apart from investments in renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectricity. Impressively, this amounts to 20% of the overall five-year capital expenditure plan made by the company.\n\nThis investment plan will help Consumers Energy build 75 MW of energy storage by 2027 in partnership with Jupiter Power in Coldwater as part of the latest agreement. This agreement will also advance CMS\u2019s capabilities toward deploying an additional 475 MW of energy storage by 2040.\nGrowth Prospects\nThe rapidly growing adoption of renewable energy sources worldwide, along with the declining cost of energy storage technologies, has been driving the demand for state-of-the-art energy storage solutions, which enable efficient energy management, grid stability and reliability, thereby ensuring a consistent power supply.\n\nTo this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm expects the global Battery Energy Storage market to witness a CAGR of 8.7% over 2024-2029. This offers solid growth opportunities to utility providers like CME Energy, which are significantly enhancing their footprints in this space.\n\nThe latest agreement with Jupiter Power is an example of CMS\u2019s efforts to gain notable traction in the battery energy storage market.\nApart from CMS, other prominent utility players, which are also expanding their footprint to reap the benefits of the expanding Battery\nStorage Market, are mentioned below.\n\nDuke Energy DUK: In April 2024, the company unveiled its PowerPair Program for installing home solar generation with battery energy storage in its service areas in North Carolina. This one-time incentive-based program offers up to $9,000 in incentives to consumers for installing solar plus battery energy storage systems. Moreover, DUK intends to put 2,700 MW of battery storage in operation by 2031.\n\nDUK\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies a rise of 3.2% over the 2023 reported figure.\n\nAlliant Energy LNT: In August 2023, the company received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to construct utility-scale battery storage facilities located at two of its solar sites. The two projects, constituting 175 MW of storage, are expected to be completed by the fall of 2025.\n\nAlliant Energy\u2018s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LNT\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 11% from the prior year\u2019s reported figure.\n\nNextEra Energy NEE: The company\u2019s subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, added approximately 1,025 MW of storage to its backlog in the first quarter of 2024. In June 2024, NextEra Energy Resources and Entergy announced a joint development agreement that would accelerate the development of up to 4.5 gigawatts of solar generation and energy storage projects.\n\nNEE\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\nPrice Movement\nIn the past six months, shares of CMS Energy have risen 3.3% against the industry\u2019s decline of 2.6%.\n Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n Zacks Rank\nCMS Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Nature\u2019s fury is unpredictable and to reduce the impact of severe weather conditions, utilities have invested millions of dollars in fortifying their infrastructure.\n\nFor 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an 85% chance of an above-normal hurricane season, with 17-25 named storms and eight to 13 hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes. This year\u2019s forecast is around 30% more storm activity compared to the number of storms predicted last year.\n\nThanks to the improvement in weather forecasts and technology, utilities can locate areas in their service territories that are historically prone to severe weather conditions. Utilities have been working on a multi-year infrastructure strategy to strengthen the electric grid, making it resilient enough to withstand the challenges posed by severe weather conditions.\n\nElectric utilities are burying outage-prone electric service lines, managing vegetation near power lines and installing smart equipment that can detect outages quickly and automatically take corrective actions. Utilities are also working to save essential equipment in flood-prone areas and strengthen the poles and wires that need to withstand the fury of nature.\n\nUtilities upgrade and strengthen electric infrastructure work throughout the year to improve their quality of service and provide service even during difficult weather conditions.\nUtilities Taking Initiatives\nMeasures taken by a few utilities to counter the hurricane season are mentioned below.\n\nDominion Energy D has been investing steadily to upgrade its infrastructure. Dominion\u2019s unit Dominion Energy Virginia has completed burying 2,000 miles of overhead power lines, which is part of the company\u2019s Strategic Underground Program. The shifting of power lines underground will lower storm-related outages and reduce the time for restoration of power in outage-prone areas during the hurricane season.\n\nNextEra Energy NEE has a comprehensive and flexible storm response plan. NextEra Energy unit Florida Power & Light Company has invested in a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid that benefits customers by improving the speed of restoration and reducing outage times following severe weather. The company has invested in a smart grid, buried power lines and replaced nearly all of its transmission structures with steel or concrete.\n\nFirstEnergy FE is also regularly making investments to strengthen its transmission and distribution network. The company is also using helicopters to inspect the transmission lines. The purpose of the inspections is to search for equipment issues that are not apparent from the ground and faults that are not visible from the ground. FirstEnergy also uses thermovision cameras to take infrared pictures of electrical equipment, assisting in the identification of possible issues in power lines.\n\nAll these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, solar stocks have not had the best performance over the past 12 months. A lot of this is related to macroeconomic uncertainty we have all been hearing about. Energy prices soared in 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Back then, solar energy looked like a competitive alternative to oil & gas energy sources. As oil prices normalized in 2023, the allure of various solar energy products began to fade away. Moreover, high interest rates and an uncertain business environment have not only made it more expensive to earmark capital expenditures for solar technology development but have constrained the budgets of various businesses and households who would have been otherwise making that transition.\nWith certain solar stocks rebounding, now may be a good time to buy in. Below are three of the smartest solar stocks to buy with just $1,000.\nFirst Solar (FSLR)\nPerson holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is currently a key part of the solar panel supply chain. The solar firm manufactures photovoltaic solar modules with a thin film semiconductor technology that ultimately provides a lower-carbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon PV solar modules. The energy transition and generous government subsidies have helped to transform First Solar into a force to be reckoned with in the space. First Solar reported $3.3 billion of revenue in fiscal year 2023, growing revenue by 26.7% on a year-over-year basis. The company also generated $830.8 million in net income, representing a margin of slightly over 25%.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAdditional tariffs on solar products that the Biden Administration recently approved will likely be a growth catalyst for First Solar on a going-forward basis. In particular, the current administration has imposed a 50% tariff on Chinese solar cells, which will ultimately benefit domestic companies.\nFSLR shares have risen nearly 45% on a year-to-date basis, but since the solar module manufacturer trades at a relatively cheap 18.5x forward earnings, it still could make a good long-term investment.\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ)\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) logo on the mobile device. Canadian is a company that manufactures photovoltaic solar modules and provides ready-to-use solar power solutions.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) has had less success over the past 12 months. The solar module and battery storage maker has seen its share price plummet 40% since the start of the year. That decline goes even further if we look at where its share price was a year ago. Sluggish growth and a legal battle have made investors weary of the stock. In particular, at the end of the first quarter, Maxeon Solar Technologies (NASDAQ:MAXN) filed a lawsuit against Canadian Solar in the U.S., accusing the company of infringing on its patent for its tunnel oxide passivated (TOP) contact solar cell technology. TOPCon modules will account for around 70% of Canadian Solar\u2019s shipments this year, and a patent lawsuit could imperil those sales.\nFortunately, Canadian Solar has maintained its U.S. operations are still functioning normally. This would not be the first lawsuit in the solar panel space and it will likely get settled in a manner that\u2019s not very obstructive to Canadian Solar\u2019s future sales.\nCanadian Solar\u2019s stock trades at 5.4x earnings, and the company generated $7.6 billion in sales in 2023, making it a sizable player that investors should consider.\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nPerson holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) makes the final entry on the list. The firm operates as both a utility company as well as a generator of energy from solar, wind and natural gas. NEE has made significant strides to become carbon neutral. Those continue to show in successive earnings reports that see the company\u2019s renewable energy portfolio increase significantly in size.\nIn NextEra\u2019s first quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, the firm\u2019s NextEra Energy Resources unit had one of its quarters for new renewables and storage origination. The business unit added approximately 2,765 MW to its energy backlog, as well as approximately 1,545 MW of solar, 145 MW of wind, 1,025 MW of storage and 50 MW of wind repowering to its backlog.\nNextEra\u2019s Florida Power & Light (FPL) utility unit also placed 1,640 megawatts of solar energy into service.\nNEE\u2019s share price is essentially trading flat for the year, but as more of these solar and wind projects come online and the market continues to warm up to solar stocks again, NEE will likely see price growth.\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We have also compiled a full free list of the Top 15 Nuclear Energy Producing Countries in the World.\nNuclear energy is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity and is considered as one of the cleanest and lowest emission sources of power. Being one of the largest global contributors of carbon-free electricity historically, nuclear power accounts for almost 10% of electricity generated globally and even rises to about 20% in advanced economies, according to International Atomic Energy Agency.\nThe increased demand of nuclear energy comes from the global energy and climate crisis. Given the energy crisis, countries are reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and have made energy security their top priority and as of today, nuclear energy stands as the second largest source of low emissions power after hydropower. In the last 50 years, nuclear energy has helped avoid over 60 gigatons or 20% of the global carbon emissions.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has predicted that the nuclear generating capacity will increase to 873 gigawatts net electrical by 2050, and the nuclear energy will account for 14% of global electricity generation. However, S&P Global has forecasted an increase in the global nuclear capacity from 415 gigawatts to 555 gigawatts. This increase will come from the 355 gigawatts that will be added between 2022 and 2025, mainly in China, as given in Insider Monkey, however, also getting offset by retirements to be made in North America and Europe.\nDespite its ability to produce emissions-free power, nuclear power still has unsure future prospects. Because of its uncertainty regarding possible billions of tons of additional carbon emissions, it faces public opposition in many countries. Large up-front costs, long lead times and poor record of on-time delivery, are some of the reasons why it has trouble competing with other alternatives.\nHowever, the challenges must outweigh the benefits because many companies have been making waves in this industry. The two biggest ones are NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ).\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a clean energy leader and the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy. The Florida-based company owns seven operating nuclear units and provides electricity and natural gas.\nAccording to the company\u2019s financial statements, for the full year 2023, NextEra Energy reported net income of $7.310 billion and an earning per share of $3.60. The company showed impressive financial performance as compared to last year when it reported a net income equaling $4.147 billion and an EPS of $2.10 per share.\nCameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ)\nCameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is a Canadian mining company that boasts the highest uranium production in the world. The company alone accounts for almost 17% of the global production, according to Insider Monkey. One of Cameco Corporation\u2019s operating areas is the McArthur River Uranium Mine, which is the world\u2019s largest high-grade uranium deposit, boasting a proven uranium reserve of 265.5 million pounds, as of 2023 year end.\nDuring the financial year 2023, Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) had a revenue of $2,588 million which showed that it grew almost 39% from the prior year at $1,868 million. The company\u2019s gross profit however had a change of even more than 110% as it grew from $233 million in 2022 to $562 million in 2023.\nTop Nuclear Energy Producing Country in the World\nMethodology\nFor the purpose of this ranking, we referred to data on Nuclear Electricity Supplied from Power Reactor Information System (PRIS). PRIS is a database on Nuclear Power Reactors developed and maintained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Through this source, we gathered data on Nuclear Electricity Supplied by every country in the year 2022. The data was then arranged in ascending order and 15 countries with the highest nuclear production were picked.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).\n1. Is United States Top Nuclear Energy Producing Country in the World?\nNuclear Production in 2022: 772,220.52 GWh\nWith Nuclear production of 772,220.52 GWh production in 2022, United States is the Top Nuclear Energy Producing Country in the World.\nThe USA is the world's largest producer of nuclear power and accounts for about 30% of global generation of nuclear electricity, according to World Nuclear Association. The country has 93 nuclear reactors that are operated by 30 different power companies across 30 different states. Nuclear power currently produces 18.2% of the total electricity generated by the United States, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nThe U.S. has also achieved efficient nuclear power plant utilization through establishing well improved maintenance & safety infrastructure at the plants, and also through enhanced refueling. As a result of this, the average electricity generation costs have jumped down from $51.22/MWh in 2012 to $30.92/MWh in 2022! This reduction was an outcome of 41% reduction of fuel costs, 51% reduction of capital expenditures and 33% reduction of operating costs.\nYou can see the full free list by going to the Top 15 Nuclear Energy Producing Countries in the World.\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 15 Biggest Nuclear Energy and Reactor Companies in the World and 15 Countries That Have Nuclear Weapons Or Nuclear Power Technology.\nDisclosure: None.

Hydropower generation is expected to see a 6% increase in 2024. Next year, the EIA expects solar will generate more electricity than hydropower for the first time in history.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nBelow are three of the leading renewable energy stocks to buy that tap into each of those sectors. By spreading investments across the full range of clean energy opportunities, investors can benefit from the advantages each brings to the market.\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nPerson holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nUtility operator NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the first renewable energy stock that investors should consider buying. It is the world\u2019s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a top-tier stock in battery storage. At the end of 2023, NextEra had approximately 72 gigawatts (GW) of total capacity in its portfolio. Of that amount, half or 36 GW came from renewables, some 70% more than its nearest competitor with wind power represented as two-thirds of the total renewable capacity.\nOver the past decade, NextEra nearly tripled its wind energy capacity and has the largest market share of North American wind capacity, all the while it keeps adding to the total. The utility has more than 20 GW backlog of wind, solar and storage contracts.\nAnalysts at McKinsey forecast between 2024 and 2030, demand for renewables and storage will expand at a 13% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). NextEra Energy will be one of the top renewable energy stocks to buy that leads the way.\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)\nBrookfield Renewable logo on a phone screen. BEPC stock. BEP stock.\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\nWhere NextEra dominates the wind market, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is the leading provider of hydropower in the country. It operates as one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded platforms for renewable power and decarbonization solutions.\nYet where 85% of Brookfield\u2019s portfolio was once hydropower generation, today it stands at about 50% as the company grew through mergers and acquisitions. It took on more solar and wind assets, such as its recently announced acquisition of Neoen, a French developer and operator of solar power plants, wind farms and energy storage solutions. The purchase gives Brookfield access to Neoen\u2019s 20 GW development pipeline.\nIn expanding its portfolio to encompass more forms of renewable energy, Brookfield Renewable has also widened the lens on where it operates. Although it primarily has projects in North America and Latin America, more recently as the Neoen acquisition shows, it is expanding more towards Europe and Asia.\nBEP is a renewable energy stock to buy because of its hydro sector dominance that cannot be easily, or readily, replicated. Building out new hydro projects faces a daunting, uphill regulatory climb. As the industry leader, Brookfield Renewable Partners is one of the best investments in the space.\nFirst Solar (FSLR)\nFirst Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nThe last renewable energy stock to buy completes the triumvirate of sources in solar. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panel technology and a pure-play in the solar panel space. It focuses on the U.S. and Indian markets where the greatest booking potential lays, particularly in the domestic utility-scale market.\nDespite the ups and downs of the solar industry over the years, First Solar has built a solid financial foundation and a strong balance sheet to weather future storms. It\u2019s thin-film cadmium telluride technology is distinctive in the industry that benefits from its simple manufacturing process.\nFirst Solar should also benefit from the Biden administration\u2019s protectionist trade policies. It recently imposed high-import barriers on cheaper Chinese panels that should give the solar shop greater opportunities, even though it comes at a higher cost to customers.\nThe solar industry is currently facing a tough market due to high interest rates slowing demand, but with its utility-scale focus, it can overcome such obstacles. The promise of interest rate cuts could spur a new growth phase.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
