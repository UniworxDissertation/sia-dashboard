In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other financial stocks.\nThe financial services industry in the US is poised for a dynamic and challenging year ahead, shaped by a confluence of economic, technological, and regulatory factors. The global economy is anticipated to grow modestly, with advanced economies like the US expecting around 1.4% growth. This is influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate-related disruptions, and persistently high inflation rates. These macroeconomic conditions are expected to significantly impact the operations and profitability of financial institutions. High interest rates have been a double-edged sword for the industry. While they have led to substantial increases in net interest income, particularly for larger banks, they have also driven up funding costs, especially for smaller and regional banks, squeezing their margins. According to Deloitte, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy will be crucial, with expectations that rates will remain elevated initially but may decrease later in the year. This will necessitate careful management of the balance between deposit rates and lending rates to sustain profitability. Economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth have prompted banks to increase their loan loss provisions as a precautionary measure to cover potential defaults. This trend is expected to persist, reflecting a cautious approach to managing credit risk amidst economic volatility and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nConcurrently, the financial services sector is experiencing significant technological shifts. Advances in AI and generative AI are set to transform various aspects of the industry, from retail investing and fraud detection to insurance offerings. However, these advancements also introduce new risks, such as heightened fraud potential and the need for robust cybersecurity measures. On the regulatory front, changes are becoming more stringent, particularly around climate-related disclosures and sustainability. Financial institutions are required to adapt to these new regulations aimed at enhancing transparency and effectively managing climate risks. These regulatory changes, coupled with technological advancements, are forcing financial institutions to innovate and evolve their business models and strategies. Overall, banks and financial institutions must remain agile and proactive, navigating these multifaceted challenges to maintain profitability and drive growth in 2024. This will involve balancing the benefits and risks of high interest rates, managing loan loss provisions prudently, leveraging technological advancements, and complying with evolving regulatory requirements.\nIn a recent development, major U.S. banks withstood a hypothetical 40% decline in commercial real estate values in the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual health test, which alleviated concerns about the banking sector amid rising interest rates. With increasing risks in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, investors were keenly observing the Fed's stress tests to gauge the exposure of American lenders at a time when pandemic-era work patterns have left office towers largely vacant, pushing vacancy rates to a historic high of 20%. Chris Marinac, head of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, commented, \u201cIn many ways, there should be a sense of relief that banks can endure a severe crisis. However, this doesn\u2019t mean the Fed believes commercial real estate is in the clear. We are still in the early stages of this credit cycle\u201d. The Fed's stress tests evaluate banks' balance sheets against a hypothetical severe economic downturn, including a 36% drop in U.S. home prices, a 55% plunge in equity prices, and an unemployment rate of 10%, reported Reuters.\nResults of the stress test released recently showed that banks could continue lending to households and businesses in the event of a severe global recession and indicated the capital needed to be deemed healthy and to determine how much they can return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. The 31 large banks tested demonstrated they had enough capital to absorb nearly $685 billion in losses. This test comes over a year after the collapse of mid-sized lenders like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic, which sparked criticism that the Fed had underestimated banks' vulnerabilities to rising interest rates, previously assuming rates would fall during a severe recession. Commercial office space is a significant concern, with $929 billion of the $4.7 trillion in outstanding commercial mortgages maturing in 2024, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This approaching maturity wall occurs amid declining property values and reduced rental income. Analysts foresee a challenging period for CRE, with banks still having \"considerable concentration risks,\" according to Moody's Ratings. Of the banks tested, Goldman Sachs had the highest projected loan loss for commercial real estate at 15.9%, followed by RBC USA (15.8%), Capital One (14.6%), and Northern Trust (13%). One critique from analysts is that the Fed's stress test did not include regional banks, which hold most of the CRE loans and are less regulated than their larger counterparts.\nOver the coming months, senior leaders in the financial services industry anticipate a challenging landscape marked by high interest rates, increased regulatory scrutiny, and persistent inflation concerns. While these trends are familiar to industry veterans, many younger employees have not encountered such conditions before. According to Deloitte, leaders will need to guide their teams through uncertainty, focusing on navigating near-term challenges and identifying potential opportunities. Looking ahead, rapid technological advancements\u2014including generative AI, cloud migration, heightened fraud and cyber risks, and the convergence of industries through embedded finance\u2014will demand unprecedented agility from financial services leaders. Adapting to these changes will require creating new strategic pathways to align with evolving market dynamics. Throughout history, the financial services sector has often driven progress by helping organizations and individuals navigate economic and societal shifts. By the end of this decade, 2024 may be recognized as a pivotal year when the future began to materialize in tangible ways. Investing now in innovative products and services that foster positive outcomes could position firms for sustained competitive advantage in the years ahead.\nOur Methodology\nWe leveraged Insider Monkey\u2019s comprehensive database of 920 prominent hedge funds to identify the top 10 financial stocks with the highest level of hedge fund investment as of Q1 2024.

But the looming high interest rate environment, combined with credit volatility and net interest margin fluctuations, impacted performance in other market segments. Experts are now wondering if share price growth can keep pace.\nIndexes measuring the overall performance of bank stocks, including the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Banks Index, were up year to date at roughly 14% and 19% as of Tuesday.\nWhile still significantly elevated, inflation decreased slightly, by 10 basis points to 3%, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on July 11, bringing the figure to its lowest level in 12 months.\nRead more: Why bank stocks may struggle to muster more momentum\nCooling inflation could help bring about an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve by September at the earliest, according to Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.\n\"We expect to see continued, albeit slow, disinflation,\" he said in a recent interview with American Banker's Jim Dobbs, adding that future rate reversals will be done gradually and will see borrowing costs remain elevated going into 2025.\nAmong those reporting positive second quarter earnings are the $563 billion-asset PNC Financial Services Group, $326 billion-asset State Street and the $428.5 billion-asset Bank of New York Mellon. Increased interest income played a hand in the Pittsburgh-based PNC's performance, while boosted assets under custody and administration and assets under management drove progress at both BNY and State Street.\nBut not every institution that recorded growth over the last three months did so unscathed.\nWells Fargo saw profits jump to $4.9 billion between April and June, up $300 million from the previous three months, but saw its net interest income sink below $12 billion for the first time in roughly two years due to heightened deposit costs and other driving conditions.\nRead more: It's time for a more collaborative approach to bank regulation\nSome executives have been working with regulators in the background of these results on multi-million dollar settlements for recent and past misdeeds.\nIn addition to recent fines against Citigroup for faults in its risk management and internal controls systems, the bank is navigating a complex overhaul plan with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to remedy those vulnerabilities.

Credit: Cooper Neill/Bloomberg\nWells Fargo's profits weighed down by rising deposit costs\n\nWells Fargo's profits rose to $4.9 billion across the last three months, driven by higher fee revenue and efforts to reduce noninterest expenses, but rising deposit costs put a damper on overall growth.\nIncreased competition with other financial institutions drove the bank to offer more interest to depositors, while high borrowing costs led to \"tepid\" loan demand from businesses, according to Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Wells Fargo. This combination of factors saw Wells Fargo's net interest income to dip below $12 billion for the first time since the Federal Reserve began raising rates in 2022.\n\"They're still having to pay more to their deposit customers,\" Kyle Sanders, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones, recently told American Banker's Polo Rocha. \"Until the Fed cuts, that's going to continue to happen.\"\nRead more: Wells Fargo's rising deposit costs continue to put a drag on profits\nCitigroup has been forecasting full-year operating expenses of between $53.5 billion and $53.8 billion. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said earlier this month that the final tally will likely wind up at the higher end of that range. Credit: Juan Cristobal Cobo/Bloomberg\nCiti stays the course for expenses amid OCC fines\n\nCitigroup executives are remaining steadfast in their full-year operating expense guidance for the bank this year, despite incurring two concurrent fines from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The civil penalties, totaling $136 million, seek to address issues related to poor data quality management that were at the heart of a pair of consent orders from 2020.\nPredictions for Citi's total operating expenses estimated between $53.5 billion and $53.8 billion, but Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told investors during the bank's earnings call on July 12 that the final number would likely be towards the higher end of that range.\n\"We are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required\" for the risk management overhaul in order \"to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind,\" Mason said.\nDespite the regulatory shake up, American Banker's Allissa Kline writes that Citi's total revenue was up 4% year-over-year, to $20.1 billion, and net income jumped by 10% from the same quarter last year, to $3.2 billion.\nRead more: Citi sticks to expense forecast as it prepares key plan for OCC\nFifth Third said this month that it waived charges or reimbursed customers years ago, that the fake accounts involved less than $30,000 in improper charges and that it will work with the CFPB to remediate customers to whom the bank has not already provided compensation.

That marked a slight drop from the first quarter, excluding a massive windfall that the megabank collected in May by cashing in Visa shares.\nFraud proofing branches, rising credit card charge-offs: JPMorgan updates\n\nVery few financial institutions are untouched by the high interest rate environment regardless of asset size, and JPMorgan Chase is no exception. The $4.1 trillion-asset bank saw a 50% boost in investment banking fees year-over-year, but was held back by consistently increasing credit card charge-offs.\nJPMorgan's net charge-off rate rose to 3.5% for the second quarter, up from 2.4% the year prior, but executives told analysts in the bank's earnings call this month that the rise in credit costs was \"not a very interesting story.\" Credit loss provisions at the bank more than doubled since the last quarter, from $1.9 billion to $3.1 billion, to account for bad loans that were charged off and provide a cushion for future instances.\nAnalysts with Piper Sandler were similarly unworried by the increase in reserves, saying in an interview with American Banker reporter Catherine Leffert that the bank's credit \"normalization\" is not indicative of any widespread challenges.\n\"I think they're just being appropriate with their reserve building, particularly given that [the] credit card [business] has been a growth area for them,\" said Scott Siefers, an analyst at Piper Sandler. \"So you just need to keep pace with that balance sheet growth.\"\nIn the foreground of JPMorgan Chase's earnings season, the bank is changing up its approach to fraud prevention by incorporating more technology across its branch network. Identity checks will be done via kiosks that prompt customers for their account password or other identification, as opposed to a teller manually verifying credentials.\nRead more: JPMorgan gets lift from investment bank, offsetting jump in credit costs\nHow JPMorgan Chase is fraud-proofing its branches\nThe credit card company, which disclosed the news earlier this month, had already set aside the money to cover the refunds it will pay under the agreement.

Within that announcement, Discover said that it had already allocated the necessary capital needed to cover the refunds under the agreement.\nThe lawsuit was among a host of issues that likely resulted in the resignation of Roger Hochschild, former president and CEO of Discover, in August 2023.\nClearing this legal hurdle is a vital part of the proposed merger between Discover and Capital One, which still requires regulatory approval and has drawn intense criticism from consumer advocacy groups fearing decreased competition in the market.\nRead more: Discover settles $1.2B loose end ahead of Capital One merger", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Bank-Earnings-Woes-Discover-Lawsuit-160000213.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.3700406253, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "WFC", "Time": "2024-07-18T07:30:00.000Z", "Headline": "Bank Stocks Rallied on Earnings.

All sides are due to return to court Friday morning.\nWells Fargo was looking to refinance $180 million of Coach debt and provide $20 million in fresh cash to fund the bus company\u2019s plan to sell all of its businesses at auction. Walrath agreed with creditors who said the $20 million was not enough to justify all of the rights Wells was demanding.\nApproving that loan would give the bank and other lenders too much power over the auction, said Shari I. Dwoskin, an attorney with the unsecured creditors committee.\n\u201cIt provides the lenders the ability to veto any result that doesn\u2019t satisfy them,\u201d Dwoskin told the judge.\nAttorneys for Wells Fargo, Coach and Renco all said they would try to work out a deal with the creditors committee and report back to Walrath.\nDebt Assumption\nRenco had agreed to assume $130 million in Coach debt as part of a binding bid that would start an auction next month. But that money would mostly benefit Wells Fargo, Walrath said, siding with the official committee of unsecured creditors. Creditors say that bid would not bring any cash into Coach.\nCompany attorneys told Walrath that they have received at least one other potential offer that, if it turns into a binding bid, would be higher than the Renco deal.\nThe creditors committee had challenged the company\u2019s sale plans and the financing package, arguing the proposals were designed to benefit Wells Fargo and other senior lenders owed more than $180 million.\nCoach USA operates a number of commuter services in the New York City area, including Rockland Coaches, Short Line, Suburban Transit and Community Coach.\nThe company blamed its bankruptcy on a decline in commuter ridership during the pandemic.\nCoach USA has said that the bankruptcy is intended to sell certain bus lines to an affiliate of Renco Group, as well as its Megabus intellectual property and retail operations.

However, there are some interesting bank stocks for long-term investors to look at right now.\nWith rates expected to start gradually falling later this year and the best-case \"soft landing\" in the economy looking more likely than it did just a few months ago, now could be a smart time to add some bank exposure to your portfolio. If you have $1,000 (or more) on the sidelines, here are two bank stocks in particular that could be worth a closer look for patient investors right now.\nAn interesting situation with lots of upside potential\nCapital One (NYSE: COF) is a bank stock that has jumped to the top of my watch list recently, and not only because it trades for a 10% discount to its book value.\nFor one thing, Capital One's business is a highly profitable one. Because of its focus on (high interest) credit card products instead of the mortgages and auto loans than many other banks specialize in, Capital One's net interest margin (NIM) is 6.7%. This is more than twice the NIM of any of the other big banks, and the business could thrive as interest rates fall and consumer confidence improves.\nHowever, perhaps the most compelling reason is Capital One's pending acquisition of Discover (NYSE: DFS), which could be a major catalyst for a few reasons:\nIt will add about 300 million credit card accounts, $20 billion in private student loans, and $87 billion in consumer deposits to Capital One.\nIt creates a more complete credit card portfolio, as both companies offer cards the other doesn't compete with.\nIt creates expense synergies. Not only are there natural economies of scale, but Capital One has a lower deposit cost structure than Discover.\nWhile all of these are net positives for Capital One, the most interesting part of the deal is that Discover owns its payment network. Capital One plans to move some of its own card volume to Discover's network and is anticipating $1.2 billion in network synergies by 2027. Beyond this, Capital One could potentially grow Discover's network and make money from interchange fees like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA).\nCould it finally be time for this bank to get back to business as usual?\nWells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has actually been one of the better performers in the financial sector so far in 2024. The economy has been more resilient than many had expected, and as the most consumer-focused of the megabanks, Wells Fargo has rebounded nicely after a turbulent 2023. But despite the outperformance, there's a lot to like about the bank stock going forward.\nFor one thing, Wells Fargo's interest margins have been compressed in the rising-rate environment. Think of it this way -- with mostly fixed-rate loans on its balance sheet and a rising deposit cost, Wells Fargo's cost of money has increased faster than the yields it generates. This contrasts with Capital One, which focuses on variable-rate credit card loans. But if interest rates start to fall later this year, as most experts predict, Wells Fargo could be one of the biggest winners.\nAlso, while the bank's \"fake accounts\" scandal might seem like a long time ago, the penalty that has been in place for about six years that prevents the bank from growing remains. However, there's reason to believe that it could finally be lifted as soon as 2025, and this could be a big deal, as it allows the bank to invest more freely to grow its consumer and wealth management businesses.\nWells Fargo has been buying back stock aggressively in recent years and growing its dividend. Despite rising by about 150% in the past four years, it still trades for about 1.3 times book value, compared with about 1.6 times book value before the asset cap was put into place.\nInvest with the long term in mind\nWhile both of these stocks look extremely interesting from a long-term perspective, it's important to keep in mind that both can (and likely will) be rather volatile over shorter periods. There are plenty of factors outside of their control that could cause the stock to spike higher or lower, but I'm confident that investors who measure their returns in multiyear periods will be glad they bought at these levels.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Capital One Financial right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Capital One Financial, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Capital One Financial wasn\u2019t one of them.

Cramer instead pitched Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) as a better buy.\n\u201cThe only one I\u2019d still buy in that group is Wells Fargo of Charlie Scharf (WFC CEO). That would be the stock to buy.\u201d\nLike Cramer, many other analysts are praising Charlie Scharf\u2019s plans to make Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) efficient. During the first quarter the company saw a 10% increase in investment banking revenue, while trading revenue jumped 15% increase YoY, amounting to $1.8 billion. The bank has notably expanded its credit card portfolio, with card balances increasing by 30% from FY19 to FY23. This growth is fueled by new product offerings and a focus on high-quality customers, with over 80% of credit cardholders having FICO scores above 660.\nIn 2024 Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC)  is expected to generate about $23 billion of pre-tax income, and $25 billion in 2025.

The earnings season happens four times a year, and it\u2019s always a time for investors and analysts to check in with the companies they follow and invest in. The season is often kicked off by three of the biggest banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citibank (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Their performance can tell us a lot about the state of the economy. There appears to be some promising news for those of us looking for a dividend with our stock appreciation.\nPrivate credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential.\nAnother Record For JPMorgan Chase\nMany big banks have enjoyed strong returns over the last several years, first among them JPMorgan Chase, which hit another record profit in the second quarter. Net income rose to $18.1 billion, and net revenue was over $51 billion. The consumer banking division activated more than 450,000 new accounts, making this the 50th consecutive quarter of net new account growth. Investment assets rose by 14%.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is known for being a bit of a doomsayer. Despite the strong returns, he noted caution in his statement, saying that the macroeconomic climate remains uncertain, with geopolitical risk still higher than average. He also stated that while inflation is cooling, it is possible that both \"inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.\"\nJPMorgan Chase isn't a stock one usually purchases for the dividend yield. The forward dividend yield is a modest 2.22%. After keeping its dividend at $1 for nearly two years, JPMorgan Chase raised it by 15% over the last four quarters to $1.15. The bank announced it is now looking to raise that to $1.25, an increase of over 8% from the previous increase. During the quarter, the bank spent a whopping $4.9 billion on share buybacks even though the stock price has increased over 20% in the past six months.\nOn the earnings call, HSBC analyst Saul Martinez questioned if JPMorgan Chase might pay a special dividend in the future. Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum indicated that paying a special dividend is not Dimon's preference and that, instead, the focus is on paying a dividend that is \"sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment.\" So, it seems an additional payout is off the table for now.\nCitigroup In Transition\nIt's been a different story at Citigroup for the last several years. CEO Jane Fraser has led the company through a massive reorganization, cutting thousands of jobs. The bank reported $3.2 billion in net income, up 10%. Revenue just barely beat expectations, coming in at $20.14 billion.\nCitigroup's troubles may be mostly in the past, but regulators still keep a sharp eye on it. The Federal Reserve Board fined the bank $60.6 million for making slow progress on managing its data appropriately. The health of the U.S. consumer is also a worry for Citi. Speaking to analysts, Chief Financial Officer Mark A.L. Mason observed that the company is seeing a divergence in consumer behavior, with its lower-income customers starting to show signs of strain. Fraser underlined that point: \"A lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing, and the underlying numbers, are being driven by the affluent customer.\"\nCitigroup has been even more cautious about its dividend payment. It held the payment at $0.51 from 2019 to the middle of 2023 and then only raised it by $0.02. It recently announced plans to increase the dividend by 6% to $0.56, which, while not a huge amount, is at least a step in the right direction. The forward yield before this increase stands at 3.23%. The company will also restart buybacks with a plan to spend $1 billion on buybacks during the coming quarter.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\nWells Fargo Moves Forward\nWells Fargo has struggled on multiple fronts over the past several years. It has faced steep fines from regulators over account mismanagement issues that led to undeserved fees and other negative consequences for its customers. Wells Fargo also has significant exposure to the mortgage market, although it has dramatically scaled back its mortgage lending, reducing its head count by 45% over the past year. Second-quarter revenue was slightly surprising to expectations, coming in at $20.29 billion.\nWhen it comes to dividend good news, we've saved the best as far as percentages. Wells Fargo reiterated its commitment to raising its dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share. It last raised its dividend one year ago and has a forward dividend yield of 2.33%. Wells Fargo was the biggest spender of these banks on buybacks, spending $12 billion over the first half the year. CEO Charlie Scharf told analysts that \"while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock.\"\nFor Wells Fargo, one dark cloud impacting its dividend future growth could be commercial real estate. On the earnings call, Scharf explained that its office real estate loan portfolio is a point of weakness: \"Fundamentals in the institutional-owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country.\"\nWhile dividends aren't the main reason to invest in large banks, these banks have all demonstrated a commitment to maintaining dividends in good times and bad.\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

Here's Why You Should Take a Look.", "Summary": "Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) recently reported its second-quarter earnings, and thanks to disappointing net interest income, the stock plunged by as much as 7% shortly after the announcement. That's a big move for a large-cap bank stock.\nWhile the interest income miss was definitely disappointing, it's important for investors to realize that this is a rock-solid financial institution that has done a great job of turning itself around in recent years, and that interest-rate headwinds are temporary. There's a lot about Wells Fargo long-term investors might like, and here's why I think it deserves a closer look, especially at a newly discounted share price.\nWells Fargo's disappointing second quarter\nWells Fargo actually beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines in the second quarter, but the problem is that the bank's net interest income declined significantly more than expected. Wells reported $11.92 billion in net interest income, a 9% year-on-year decline, and about $200 million less than analysts had been expecting.\nThe short explanation is that while interest rates have risen in recent years, the bank's cost of funding -- deposits, borrowing, and so on -- has increased at a faster rate than the yields from its loan portfolio. Plus, the loan portfolio itself has contracted by about 3% over the past year, especially because of weak mortgage and auto loan demand. For example, mortgage originations fell from an already weak $7.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023 to $5.3 billion.\nThe quarter wasn't all bad. Fee-based revenue has grown, specifically when it comes to investment advisory fees, trading revenue, and investment banking fees. Noninterest expense actually declined 2% sequentially. And the bank's net charge-off rate remains well covered by its reserves. But the sharp decline in net interest income seems to be scaring investors a bit.\nReasons to be optimistic\nThere's a lot to like about Wells Fargo from a long-term perspective. For starters, the interest-rate headwind is a temporary one. Rising rates have put pressure on margins, but if rates normalize over the next few years as expected, it could go the other way. And as the most consumer-focused of the U.S. megabanks, Wells Fargo arguably has the most to gain when rates fall.\nThe bank has also done a great job of prioritizing capital return to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and buybacks. As mentioned in the introduction, Wells just increased its dividend by 14% and now yields 2.5%. And when it comes to buybacks, Wells Fargo spent $12 billion on buybacks -- roughly 6% of its entire market cap -- in the first half of 2024 alone.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve's asset cap that essentially prevents Wells Fargo from growing has been in place for years, but there's reason to believe it could be lifted within the next couple of years. The bank traded for an average of about 1.6 times book value before it was implemented, and its multiple is currently less than 1.3.\nThe bottom line is that Wells Fargo already looked like an attractive long-term investment opportunity before earnings, and it looks even better now. To be sure, depending on what happens with interest rates and the economy in general, it could be volatile for some time. But this looks like a great entry point for patient investors who measure their returns in years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Wells Fargo right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Wells Fargo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Wells Fargo wasn\u2019t one of them.

As I mentioned in Friday\u2019s Market 360, FactSet projects the S&P 500 will achieve earnings growth of 9.3% in the second quarter and 4.8% revenue growth.\nIf the actual growth rate is 9.3%, it would not only be the fourth-consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, but also the highest year-over-year earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2022.\nThree of the big banks \u2013 Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) \u2013 marked the official start of earnings season with their second-quarter earnings reports yesterday morning. Last week, FactSet expected the Financial sector  to post 4.3% earnings growth, but the Banks industry was anticipated to post a 10% earnings decline. Excluding the Banks industry, the Financial sector\u2019s expected earnings growth rate was 14.8%.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nFollowing their results, the Financial sector is now forecast to achieve 10.7% earnings growth in the second quarter, with the Banks industry expected to report 7% earnings growth.\nThis is a significant earnings revision, so let\u2019s use today\u2019s Market 360 to review Citigroup\u2019s, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s and Wells Fargo\u2019s to review their quarterly numbers. I\u2019ll also share if they are good buys right now. And then, I\u2019ll reveal how you can prepare for an incoming financial wave that could shock the market (hint: it has nothing to do with earnings).\nCitigroup Inc. (C)\nCitigroup announced earnings of $1.52 per share on $20.14 billion in revenue, topping estimates of $1.39 per share and $20.07 billion in revenue. This compares to earnings of $1.33 per share and $19.4 billion in revenue in the same quarter a year ago.\nBanking revenues jumped 38% to $1.6 billion, thanks in part to the strength in Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenue increased 60% year-over-year to $853 million due to investment grade bond issuance, while Corporate Lending rose 7% to $756 million, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges.\nCEO Jane Fraser noted in the earnings press release:\nOur results show the progress we are making in executing our strategy and the benefit of our diversified business model\u2026 Markets had a strong finish to the quarter leading to better performance than we had anticipated\u2026 The recent stress tests again showcased strength on our balance sheet\u2026 We will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and continue to further improve our returns over time.\nAlthough shares of Citigroup opened higher following the earnings report, they turned lower in afternoon trading.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)\nJPMorgan reported adjusted earnings of $4.40 per share on $50.2 billion in revenue. Analysts were calling for earnings of $4.19 per share and revenue of $49.87 billion, so the bank beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.\nBanking & Wealth Management slipped 5% to $10.4 billion, while Markets & Securities Services revenue increased 8% to $9 billion and Markets revenue climbed 10% to $7.8 billion. Investment Banking fees surged 50%.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also provided comments on the U.S. economy and inflation. Regarding the economy, he said:\nWhile market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II \u2013 though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown.\nAs for inflation, Dimon commented:\nNext, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale.\nJPMorgan is sticking to its full-year net interest income forecast of $91 billion, excluding trade revenue. JPM shares fell more than 2% in early trading on the heels of the report.\nWells Fargo & Company (WFC)\nWells Fargo reported earnings of $1.33 per share on $20.69 in revenue. Analysts were expecting $1.29 earnings per share on $20.29 billion in revenue. Consumer Banking and Lending revenue declined 5% to $9 billion, Commercial Banking fell 7% to $3.1 billion, while Corporate and Investment Banking rose 4% to $4.8 billion.\nMore important, net income declined 9% year-over-year to $11.92 billion, below analysts\u2019 estimates for $12.12 billion.\nCEO Charlie Scharf expects net income to improve. In the Wells Fargo earnings press release he said:\nWe continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income. The investments we have been making allowed us to take advantage of the market activity in the quarter with strong performance in investment advisory, trading, and investment banking fees.\nWells Fargo also maintained its net income outlook for 2024. It expects net income to decline 7% to 9% to $52.4 billion. Shares of Wells Fargo fell more than 5% on Friday.\nAre These Banks Buys?\nEven though Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all beat earnings and revenue estimates, I would not view them as buys.\nIf you\u2019re a longtime reader of mine, you know I\u2019m not a big fan of the \u201cbig banks.\u201d That\u2019s because I am an ex-banking regulator and I know they sometimes play fast and loose with their numbers.\nBack in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the yield curve was severely inverted, I used to merge two money-losing financial institutions together so they could qualify for FSLIC or FDIC insurance. Essentially, I would take the largest financial institution and merge it into the smaller one, but would re-amortize its assets (e.g., loan portfolio) to make the combined financial institution look better.\n\nEven though I could never fix the combined financial institution\u2019s cash flow, I helped them kick the can down the road, since an inverted yield curve is lethal for banks. In other words, I used to put lipstick on a pig. My experience scarred me for life, which is why I rarely recommend banks.\nThe Incoming Financial Wave\nWhile Wall Street will likely be mostly focused on earnings over the next six weeks, there\u2019s another financial tidal wave coming that could rock the stock market.\nWhen it makes landfall, its impact will be more violent and more severe than any financial crisis we\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe tidal wave that\u2019s set to wreck our economy is due to artificial intelligence.\nSo, how can you survive?\nSome might think the best way to survive this tsunami is by moving off the grid or buying gold. But the reality is the way to protect yourself is by investing. Owning stock in world-class companies has always been \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 an essential stronghold in times of technological change.\nThe stock market is the only place I know that allows you to align yourself with innovators, entrepreneurs and wealthy corporations gaining a critical early foothold in these new technologies.\nIn other words, it\u2019s time to go stock picking \u2013 and I have found nine world-class AI- and quantum computing-related stocks that are great buys now.\nClick here to learn how you can access this exclusive portfolio of stocks.\n(Already a Growth Investor subscriber?

Total earnings for these Finance companies are up +0.2% from the same period last year on +11.5% higher revenues, with 100% EPS and revenue beats percentages at this stage.\nLooking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q2 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +10.8% on +6.6% higher revenues.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\nIncluding the aforementioned reports from JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo, we now have Q2 results from 27 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 27 index members are up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues, with 81.5% beating EPS estimates and only 44.4% able to beat revenue estimates.\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with 45 S&P 500 members on deck to report results. This week\u2019s line-up is heavily weighted toward the Finance sector, but we do have several bellwethers from other sectors reporting results, including Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth, Netflix, Schlumberger, and others.\nThis is too small a sample of results to draw any conclusions from, but the comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis is by no means a representative sample of results at this early stage, but we will be keenly looking at how the revenue beats percentage evolves in the days ahead, as we are off to a rough start on that count.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 27 companies in a historical context.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.5% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period since the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nYou can see in the chart below that the $513 billion in aggregate S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are above the $512.3 billion earned by the index in 2023 Q3.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.8% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index-level aggregate earnings growth for the year remaining unchanged on an ex-Finance basis.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Earnings Season Gets Underway: Bank Earnings in Focus \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second-quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. So, let me start with some second quarter highlights.\nOur financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continue to generate strong fee-based revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities, and investment banking. These results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Credit performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations.\nConsumers have benefited from the strong labor market and wage increases. The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit tightening actions, and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations. In our commercial portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties, where we expect losses to remain lumpy.\nFundamentals in the institutional owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has driven head count to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter.\nThe higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand, and we have not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balance growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly from the first quarter, with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses. Now, let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk controller.\nWe are a different Wells Fargo from when I arrived. Our operational and compliance risk and control build-out is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed, and we embed this mindset into our culture, similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risk today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment.\nWhile we see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity, and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set for ourselves. While we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment, the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. We are also a different Wells Fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time.\nLet me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making. For diversity revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income, we are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings, which is both -- which is important both for our customers and strategically for the company. During the second quarter, we launched two new credit cards, a small business card and a consumer card. Since 2021, we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product build-out.\nThe momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth. We are not lowering our credit standards but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well received by the market. Building a larger credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing, promo rates, onboarding, and allowance, which drive little profitability in the early years. But as long as our assumptions on spend, balance growth, and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures.\nWe have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank, which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us. We are executing on a multiyear investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline and our positive momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth. Fernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate and Investment Banking.\nFernando has deep knowledge of our industry, and his background and skills complement the terrific team Jon Weiss has put together. While we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short and medium term and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year. In our wealth and investment management business, we have substantially improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisors and our consumer banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth. In the commercial bank, we are focused on growing our treasury management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead.\nAnd we continue to see significant opportunities for consumer, small, and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth. Let me give you just a few examples of some of the things we're doing here. We continue to optimize and invest in our branch network. While our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we are being more strategic about branch location strategy.\nWe are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 296 during the first half of this year and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five years. As part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we are also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience, which has been a positive for both our bankers and our customers. We continue to have strong growth in mobile users with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117 million interactions.\nWe expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional self-service features and value-added insights including balance trends and subscription spending. Looking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth. However, the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still-elevated inflation and elevated interest rates.\nAs managers of a large complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients. The actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments. And while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us. Our commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work.\nWe have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream, and are seeing the early progress in our results. And we have maintained strong financial risk discipline and a strong balance sheet. Operating with a strong capital position in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirements resulting from Basel III finalization has served as well. It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year. And while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo.\nI'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was 4.9 billion or $1.33 per diluted common share. EPS grew from both the first quarter and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments we've been making. We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company.\nI will also note that our second-quarter effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first-quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 percentage points versus a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had an offsetting increase to noninterest income. Turning to Slide 4. As expected, noninterest income was down, net interest income was down 1.2 billion or 9% from a year ago.\nThis decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses, as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Net interest income declined 304 million or 2% from the first quarter. Given the higher rate environment meet commercial loan demand, loan balances continue to decline as expected.\nWe saw positive trends, including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customer-facing businesses, including within our consumer business. Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter. This slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points in the second quarter after increasing 16 basis points in the first quarter. If the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing would begin to decline with the most immediate impact of new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing move faster as rates increase, and we would expect betas to also be higher as rates decline.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the first quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses, driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and continued consumer spending. Average deposits grew 4.9 billion from the first quarter. Commercial deposits have grown for three consecutive quarters as we successfully attracted clients' operational deposits. After declining for nearly two years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter.\nWe've seen outflows slow as many rate-seeking customers in wealth and investment management have already moved into cash alternative products, and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer small and business banking. These improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce higher cost market funding. The migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining from 26% in the first quarter to 25%. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 6.\nNoninterest income increased 19% from a year ago, with growth across most categories reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in interest income with revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment goals. Turning to expenses on Slide 7.\nSecond-quarter noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, an increase in revenue-related compensation, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense. Operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. The 7% decline in noninterest expense in the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from the first quarter to 57 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by higher commercial net loan charge-offs, which were up 127 million from the first quarter to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last quarter, they were in line with our expectations.\nAs we have previously stated, commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work to derisk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process. These efforts helped to reduce our office commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased 25 million from the first quarter to 88 basis points of average loans.\nAuto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the credit tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus as more recent vintages -- and as more recent vintages mature. Importantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we currently expect the credit card charge off rate to decline in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets increased 5% from the first quarter, driven by the higher commercial real estate office nonaccruals.\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter, driven by declines across most asset classes, partially offset by a higher allowance of credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent. Our allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% for the past several quarters.\nTurning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11% continue to be well above our current 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We are also above our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the fourth quarter of this year as our stress capital buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%. We repurchased 6.1 billion of common stock in the second quarter.\nAnd while the pace will slow, we have capacity to continue to repurchase common stock as Charlie highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14% subject to board approval. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11. Consumer, small, and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products.\nTotal lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continue to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue. Auto revenue declined 25% from last year, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on simplifying the home lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced head count in home lending by approximately 45%. Balances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with the year ago, driven by lower origination volumes, which were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting previous credit-tightening actions.\nBoth debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 13. The middle market banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 17% year over year, including lower net interest income, lower lease income, and revenue from equity investments.\nAverage loan balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment and a market where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, partially offset by lower treasury management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts.\nCommercial real estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in equities, structured products, and credit products. Average loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate where our originations remain muted, and we have strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio, as well as declines in banking where clients continue to access capital goods funding. On Slide 15, wealth and investment management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago.\nHigher asset-based fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income, reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs, as customers reallocated cash into higher yielding alternatives. As a reminder, the majority of WIM and advisory assets are priced at the beginning in the quarter, so the third-quarter results will reflect market valuations as of July 1st, which were up from both a year ago and from April 1st. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments.\nTurning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on Slide 17. At the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than full-year 2023. During the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected with net interest income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations, which has helped us reduce market funding.\nDeposit costs increased during the first half of this year as expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed. However, late in the second quarter, we increased pricing in wealth and investment management on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, better aligns rates with rates paid in money market funds, and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year. Our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances.\nAt the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year. As we highlighted on our first-quarter earnings call, loan balances were weaker than expected, and that trend continued into the second quarter. We expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second-quarter levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full-year 2024 net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in January, were down approximately to 9% from full-year 2023.\nWe continue to expect net interest income will trough toward the end of the year. We are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately 52.6 billion.\nWe currently expect our full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately 54 billion. There are three primary drivers for this increase. First, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations, driving higher revenue-related compensation expense in wealth and investment management. As a reminder, this is a good thing if these higher expenses were more than offset by higher noninterest income.\nSecond, operating losses and the other customer remediation-related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Finally, we did not anticipate the 336 million of expense in the first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment, which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses.\nIn summary, our results in the second quarter reflected the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance. Our strong growth in fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remains strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and we continue to make progress on our path to sustainable ROTCE of 15%.\nWe will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nAt this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. Good morning. Mike, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points you made on the changes on the deposit cost side. First of all, I guess, relative to the 12 basis points that you saw in terms of interest-bearing cost increase, which was lower than the 17, how do you just generally expect that to look going forward? And how -- and is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going forward? Thank you.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Ken. Yes, we mean -- the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward. You saw about -- basically about a month's worth in the quarter, we made the change in June.\nSo, you saw about a third of a quarterly impact already included in the number. Look, I think when you drill into what's going on in the deposit side, I'd say a few things. One, overall -- we're not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits. On the consumer side, this migration that's been happening now for a while from checking into savings or CDs, it's still happening but at a slower pace.\nAnd you can see that over the last couple of years as it's been pretty stable over the last quarter or two, but it's definitely slowing as you look at the quarter. And so, I'd anticipate you'd still see more migration, but continuing to slow as we look forward. On the wholesale side, we -- the pricing has been pretty competitive now for a while, and that's the case. And so, we've been pleased to see that we're able to grow good operational deposits.\nAnd so, given the competitive pricing there, that puts a little near term pressure on NII, but those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long period of time, particularly as rates start to come back down. And so, the positive, I think, overall, as you saw deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time, and that migration is slowing to higher-yielding alternatives. And so, we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year, but I think there's some good positive trends that are emerging there.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. And just a follow-up. The fees were really good, and the trading business continues to demonstrate that it's taking market share.\nI guess, how do we understand how to kind of measure that going forward, right, versus what the group is doing? You guys are definitely zigging and outperforming there. Where do you think you are in terms of market share gains, and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run rate of trading is going forward? Thanks.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I'll take that, and Charlie can chime in if he wants. The -- as you look at trading at any given quarter, it's going to bounce around, right? So, you can't necessarily straight line any single quarter. So, I'd be careful there as you look forward.\nBut I think the good part is like we've been methodically sort of making investments in really all of the asset classes, FX, credit to lesser degree in equities and other places, but we're getting the benefit of those investments each quarter on an incremental basis. I think that business is still constrained by the asset cap. And so, we are not growing assets or financing clients assets at the same level we would be if we didn't have the asset cap, which also then drives more trading flow as we go. And so, I'd say we're methodically sort of building it out and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while.\nBut any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on what's happening in the market or an asset class. And we're getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow to us.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things, which is, as we think about the things that we're doing to invest in our banking franchise, both markets and the investment banking side of the franchise, it's not risk-based. It's actually -- it's focused on customer flows on the trading side. It's focused on expanding coverage and improving product capabilities on the banking side.\nSo, what we look at -- and we're also very, very focused on returns overall, as you can imagine, as all the other large financial institutions are. So, as we're looking at our progress, we do look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up. And so, as you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace, we are looking at a sustained level of growth, recognizing that we don't control the quarter-to-quarter volatility.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK, got it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. You expressed confidence that NII should bottom toward the year end or toward the back half of this year. Maybe you could just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view just given the loan growth dynamics that you mentioned and you just mentioned the funding cost in the rate backdrop? If you could just kind of walk us through your confidence in that inflection and, I guess, what it could mean as you go into 2025?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We won't talk much about 2025, John. But as you sort of look at what's happening, you're seeing this pace of migration on the deposit side flow, as I mentioned earlier. So, you're seeing more stability as time goes by there.\nYou're -- once the Fed starts lowering rates, which the market expects to happen later in the year, you'll start to see betas on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base. You'll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing on the asset side as you see more securities and more loan sort of roll. And so, you got to look -- exactly calling sort of the trough is which quarter it's going to be, sometimes can be a little tough. But as you sort of look at all the components of it, we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, thanks. And if I just hop over to capital, buybacks, somebody bought back about 6.1 billion this quarter, similar to the first quarter. You indicated the pace will slow. Maybe if you could give us a little bit of color on how we should think about that moderation and how long that could persist at this point? And how long until you could be back at the run rate you were previously?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me take a shot at it, Mike, and then you can add the color on this one. Listen, I think when you look at where we've been running capital, we've been trying to anticipate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about SCB as well as the uncertainty that exists with where Basel III ultimately comes out. The reality of those two things are, we know where the SCB is for this year at this point. We still don't know where Basel III ultimately winds up.\nSo, I think as we sit here today, we will continue -- we'll be conservative on capital return in the shorter term until we learn more about exactly where Basel III will ultimately wind up, and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital returns. So, I just -- I think we're just trying to be very pragmatic. The reality is we're still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonably sized dividend that's increased as our earnings power has increased. Given the fact that we have constraints, most of what the remainder of our capital generation goes toward capital return, but we want to see where Basel III ultimately winds up.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Just maybe one follow-up first, Mike and Charlie, on capital. Is 11% the line in the sand right now as you wait for Basel and clarity there as we, at least, you're not guiding for it, but as we think about what the pace of buybacks might be or could CET1 go below 11%, still significant buffer with the 9.6% minimum? Would appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think where we are a plus a little bit, probably not minus a little bit, but plus some is probably the right place to be at this point. Remember, the SCB was higher than we expected. And so, that's factoring into our thinking. And so, that's really what's driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point.\nBut again, hopefully, we'll get some more clarity on Basel III. We know what you know, and then we'll be much clearer about what we think the future looks like there. But again, overall, we still have the capacity to buy back. We just -- as we've always been, we want to be prudent.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And then just moving to expenses. So, I get the expense guide increased. But remind us, has anything changed maybe, Charlie, from you first, on the expense flex that's a big part of the wealth thesis around efficiency gains, which should lead to the path for that 15% ROTCE? And what are you baking in in terms of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide? Like does it assume elevated levels of trading in IB? Thank you.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me just take the first part. So, just -- and I appreciate you asking the question. I think as far -- from where -- as we look forward, nothing has changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient. That story is no different today than it was yesterday or last quarter.\nAs we increased the estimates for the year, it's really reflective of three broad categories. One are the variable expenses that relate to our wealth and investment management business where we have higher revenues that results in higher payout. And as Mike always points out, that's actually a good thing, even though it's embedded in the expense line, which causes that number to head upwards. The second thing are the fact that we've had higher customer remediations and FDIC expenses in the first half of the year than when we contemplated the expense guidance.\nOn the customer remediations, we've said it's -- they're not new items, they're historical items. We're getting closer to the end of finalization in these things. And as that occurs, things like response rates and making sure that we've identified every -- the full amount of the population gets all fine-tuned, and that's what's flowing through. But that's a -- it really rates to historical matters and not something that's embedded in what we see in the business going forward.\nSo, what you're left with is the rest of the earnings -- I'm sorry, the expense base of the company, and it's playing out as we would have expected. And so, as we sit here and look forward, all the statements I made in the past are still true, which is, we're not as efficient as we need to be; we're focused on investing in growing the business; we're focused on spending what's necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure; and we're focused on driving efficiency out of the company. And that lever is -- continues to be exactly what it's been.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nGot it. And you assume fees staying elevated in the back half as part of the guidance?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We assume equity markets are about where they are today, so it's still staying pretty elevated.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. First, I just want to put context to this question because I didn't want to ask it just in isolation because it seems ticky-tacky, but it's not. So, the stock is down 7.5%. And if I just take consensus to the higher end of your NII range to 9, that would imply that consensus would adjust 3.5% in isolation.\nSo, this is just a context of why I'm asking this question on expenses. So, your expenses went up in terms of -- from your original guide 1.4 billion. I guess -- and you laid out those three bullets, and you quantified FDIC special assessment. I guess I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more the remediation expenses and the op losses were up versus your original expectation.\nBecause I think what the market wants to understand is PP -- NII, OK, we get it, that's happening because of deposit repricing. But is core PPNR outside of that going up, right? I just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the EPS going to be down as much coming out of this as the market is indicating.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, Erika, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. We give you the operating loss line in the supplement.\nSo, you can see that. And if you -- based on what we had said in January, if you assume that the $1.3 billion on a full year basis was just split evenly across all the quarters, you can see that the operating losses are up about $500 million year to date over that run rate. So, that's the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is year to date in the first half.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, then you take that, you add the FDIC to it.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nRight. And the remainder is roughly the revenue-related expenses in wealth management.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo that's why, Erika, when I was talking before, when you look at what's driving the increase in the expense guide, it is -- its remediations in the first and second quarter. It's the FDIC expense that you've seen, and it's the increase in variable expenses. Everything else is playing out as we would have expected.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. That makes sense. And just maybe some comments on how you're thinking about credit quality from here.\nIt looks like you continue to release reserves in the second quarter. Is this a message that you feel like you've captured most of the CRE-related issues, of course, absent of a further deterioration in the economy? And how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your charge-offs?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, when you say -- well, I think when we look at the reserves, you have to bucket into different pieces. Our exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business and are -- based on underwriting changes we've made, it's not just balances, but also the actual losses. So, that's what's driving the reductions in that part of the loss reserves on the consumer side. And on the credit card side, it's really driven -- the increase is really driven by balances.\nSo, you've got two very different dynamics going on there, with the releases being just representative of a smaller, higher credit quality credit portfolio. And then on the wholesale side, we're -- the losses that we've seen and the credit performance in our CIB office CRE portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we set our ACL, but there's still uncertainty there. So, we're maintaining the coverage. So, overall, there's really -- in terms of our expectations, no real change from what we're seeing in the CRE portfolio, which is where the loss content is actually coming through.\nAnd elsewhere, things are still fairly benign other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business, but no real trend there.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you, Charlie and Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit cost for wealth? Was it to keep up with competition? Or is it trying to get ahead of some potential pricing pressures? What was kind of the logic there?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hey, it's Mike, Matt. So, this was very specific to a sweep product in the wealth business. So, it's a portion of that overall deposits, and it doesn't have any bearing on any other products.\nSo, I would leave with that very specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And how big is that, those deposit balances?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWe didn't -- we don't -- that's not something we normally have out there. But you can see the impact is -- I sort of highlighted the impact is roughly $350 million for the rest of the year for the second half of the year. So, I would just use that as -- and that's already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And then just a separate topic here. I mean the credit card growth has been very good. You highlighted rolling out some new products.\nAnd the question is always when you -- anyway growth kind of still makes sense in certain category, even if they are not growing too quickly. The loss rates have gone up maybe a little more than some peers, not as much as from others, obviously in line with what you were targeting. There was that negative Wall Street Journal article on one of your cards. So, just kind of taken together, what kind of checks and balances you have to make sure that a somewhat new initiative for you that you're growing at the right pace? Thank you.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So, Mike, I'll start, and then you can chime in. So, first of all, we -- when we look at our credit card performance, we do not look at it in total, right? We look at each individual product. We look at all of the performance broken out by vintage.\nAnd we compare the results that we're seeing, both in terms of balance build as well as credit performance, not losses, but starting very early with early on books delinquencies. And we look at how they're playing out versus pre-pandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the product. As I said, we look at the actual quality of the consumers that we're underwriting and the overall credit quality. We haven't compromised credit quality at all.\nWe've probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on relative to where we had been, but the actual performance when you look at the vintages is it's really spot on with what we would have expected. So, what you're seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio. And the last thing I'll just say is just when you think about the Wall Street Journal article, that -- we've launched a lot -- a bunch of new credit cards. That is a -- relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards that we issue and what our strategy is, that's a very, very, very small piece of it.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I would just add one piece. As you look at new account growth, we're not originating anything less than 660. So, as Charlie mentioned, some of the credit tightening with 660 FICO, sorry.\nSo, as Charlie mentioned, the credit box has not been brought in really at all. And when you look at some of the bigger products like cash back -- the cash back card, active cash, the new originations are coming in at a higher credit quality than the back book was. And so, at this point, as Charlie said, we go through it at a very, very granular level each quarter, and results are kind of right where we expect. And if we start to see any kind of weakness at all, we're adjusting where needed.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd just one last comment here, which is again because I appreciate the question. Whatever -- it's -- whenever you see a lot of growth in a product that has risk in it, it's always the right thing to ask the questions. We're not -- this isn't -- the people that are doing this, both in our card business, Kleber who runs consumer lending, myself, like this is not a new product for us. We've seen this happen in the past, we've seen people do this well, and we've seen people not do this well.\nAnd so, we're very, very conscious of the risks that you're pointing out as we go forward just as we are on the other businesses that we're investing in.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. And obviously, you talked about card losses going down in 3Q. So, it's consistent with what you said as well.\nSo, thank you for the color.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYep. Absolutely.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSo, I just wanted to make sure on the expense guide, I get the point that a bunch of that is related to better revenues from wealth management. And so, we should be anticipating, as a part of that, that revenues for wealth management in the second half is going to be at least at one-half or maybe even a little higher. Is that fair?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, Betsy, I covered that in my script, too. So, as you look at the advisory assets there, they get priced based on -- and most of them get priced in advance for the quarter. So, you know what third quarter looks like based on where we are now.\nAnd obviously, it's not all equity market. There's some fixed income in there as well. But you should see a little bit of an increase as you go into the third quarter based on where the markets are now, and then we'll see what the fourth quarter looks like when we get there.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYeah, OK. So, I just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev beat. I know you're not guiding revs up but interpretation leads you down that path. And so, then I guess the other piece of the question I had just had to relate with, the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier.\nAnd what's your view of interest in leaning into the markets business today? I realize there's opportunity. There's still the asset cap constraint, but you're not at the asset cap. So, there is room for you to lean in. There are players who are a little bit more constrained on capital than you even in that space.\nSo, is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into, especially when C&I and CRE and other types of loans are low demand right now, as you indicated earlier? Thanks.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me start. I think -- so, first of all, relative to where the balance sheet is running, we're not -- let me say we want to -- we're careful about how we run the overall balance sheet, right, which is we don't want to operate at the cap on a regular basis because you've got to be prepared both for customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when you see it as well as we lived through COVID where there was an event. And all of a sudden, there were a bunch of draws, and we have to live within that asset cap. So, running it with the cushion is a very smart thing, we think, for us to do, even though you can argue we're giving up some shorter-term profit.\nSo, that's just the reality of where we live. And so, as we think about the markets business and what that means, in the perfect world, we'd be allowing them to finance some more. There are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that. But what we are doing is, as we think about inside the company, optimizing the balance sheet and where we get the most returns and where there's more demand and less demand.\nThere has been less demand in other parts of the company, and there's been more demand on the trading side. So, our assets are actually up 15-ish percent.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Trading -- if you go to the supplement deck, trading assets on an average basis are up 17%, a little more on a spot basis.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, we're just trying to -- so, we're reflective of what those opportunities are, but we've got to keep capacity for the reasons I mentioned.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. OK, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Charlie, you mentioned in your opening comments about Fargo.\nYou guys launched Fargo over a year ago, I guess, and you're having real good pickup. Can you share with us any other AI-orientated programs that are in work in progress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies or cost savings or even revenue enhancements as you go forward?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. As we first -- when we think about AI, we do break it into different categories, right? There is traditional AI and then there is GenAI. We have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the company with just traditional AI. And that is -- it's in marketing, it's in credit decisioning, it's in information that we provide bankers on both the wholesale, on the consumer side about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a discussion about.\nAnd so, that is -- in a lot of respects, that's business as usual for us. The new opportunity that exists with GenAI is where AI creates something based upon whether it's public data on our own data in terms of things that haven't existed. We are most focused in the shorter term on things that can drive efficiency. But it also contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers.\nSo, great examples of things like that are call centers. We take lots of phone calls, and we've got lots of opportunities through AI to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep. But once they get to a call center rep, we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly but also making sure that we're capturing that information, understanding root cause across all these calls we get. That means bankers have to go -- telephone bankers have to go in, actually enter what the call was about, what they think the root cause is.\nWe then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth. Through GenAI, that can be done automatically. It could be done immediately, and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause so then we can go back, look at it, and make sure that's the case and make the change. So, ultimately, that results in fixing defects going forward, but it also takes so much manual effort out of what we do.\nAnd so, that's -- and so, any place where something is written, something is analyzed by an individual, we've got the opportunity to automate that. Those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side. To the extent that they impact a consumer, we're going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that. And so, the work is a meaningful part of as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nVery good. I appreciate those insights. And then just as a quick follow-up, you also mentioned about improved advisor retention in the quarter. And when you look at your wealth and investment management segment, I recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver in investment advisory and other asset-based fees are in revenues for this division.\nBut I noticed that they've been flat to down this year. They're up over a year ago. Is it seasonal in the second quarter that that line of business just gets soft? Or is it the higher rate environment where customers are just leaving more cash in -- more assets in cash because they're getting 5% or so?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. There really is no rhyme or reason necessarily, Gerard, to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next necessarily. Obviously, if there's like large bouts of volatility, you might see more transaction activity. That certainly hasn't been the case necessarily in the equity market in the second quarter.\nBut to some degree, as that line item over a very long period of time, that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up. And that's actually a really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nYep. OK, super. OK, appreciate it. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator\nAnd our final question for today will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Just given the sheer amount of, I guess, investor questions that we've received on the deposit pricing changes in wealth, I was hoping you could provide some additional context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating or at least being in the very late innings.\nAnd I want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing? Was it impacting advisor recruitment or retention? Was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet? And -- or is this an effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing and sweep deposits and force others to potentially follow suit?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Steve. It's Mike. I'd say just a couple of things. One, this is not in reaction to cash sorting.\nWe are seeing cash sorting slow in the wealth business just like we're seeing that in the consumer business. So, this is not a reaction to that in any way. It's a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the wealth business. And it is very specific to this product, which is in an advisory account where there's frictional cash there.\nSo, it's not a reaction to competitive forces that we're seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And just one follow-up on the discussion relating to expenses. And just given the fee momentum that you're seeing within CIB and wealth, and you're clearly making investments in both of those segments, at the same time, the incremental margins have actually been quite high, especially in CIB, where it's running north of 75% just first half this year versus last. I was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee momentum being sustained what do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within CIB and wealth recognizing the payout profiles are different.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWell, let me start on the wealth side, and I'll come back to the iBanking or banking side. So, on the wealth side, what's really going to help us drive margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things. One is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side, which you can see happening. And then two, and we've talked about this in other forums, it's doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking and lending products.\nSo, when you look at our loans in the wealth business and you look at the overall asset base or the advisor for us, we're much less penetrated than some of the peers. And so, I think those things really help drive us to get to more best-in-class margins, which are higher than where we sit today. And that takes some time. On the lending side, in this rate environment, it's a little harder to drive that growth.\nAnd as rates start to come down, you'll probably see more demand there. And so, there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come to from a timing perspective. But those are things that the Barry Sommers and the whole management team in wealth are very focused on and making sure we've got the right capabilities, the right sales force, the right support for the sales force, and so forth. On the iBanking side, we've been making investments in that business now for the better part of two-plus years, a little longer than that probably.\nAnd as we're adding good people, we're also -- not necessary -- we're also making sure that we've got the right people in the right seats. And so, you're not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior headcount. You're actually -- we're making sure we got the right people in the right seats. And so, you've seen some reductions as you've seen some growth.\nAnd so, that's helping also moderate the overall investment. And then also, as we brought those people on, you're paying them full freight when you recruit people, right? So, what you're seeing is, you're getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now, but you've already got the expense and the run rate to some degree. And so, I think you'll see that pace of margin expansion moderate over time, but what you're seeing is what you should expect, which is like we made the investments, you're paying the people now they're becoming productive incrementally each quarter, and that's good to see.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nThat's really helpful color, Mike.

Investors are viewing the glass as half-empty, sending Wells Fargo shares down 7% as of 11 a.m. ET.\nHigh rates are causing headaches\nWells Fargo has done a good job rebounding after a difficult period, but the higher-for-longer interest rate cycle has weighed heavily on banks this year. Wells Fargo reported second-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion, topping the $20.2 billion estimate but falling from $20.9 billion in the previous quarter.\nThe bank delivered earnings of $1.33 per share, topping the $1.28-per-share consensus estimate.\n\"Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were reflected in our second quarter financial performance as diluted earnings per common share grew from both the first quarter and a year ago,\" CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement. \"We continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income.\"\nBut the next few months are unlikely to get any easier. Wells Fargo said it expects full-year net interest income to fall 8% to 9%, compared to previous guidance for down 7% to 9%. Noninterest expense guidance was raised by $1.4 billion to $54 billion, due to higher compensation expense and a special assessment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nThe bank's provision for credit losses in the quarter was $1.24 billion, up from $938 million in the first quarter but down from $1.71 billion in the same three months of 2023.\nIs Wells Fargo a buy?\nWells Fargo under Scharf has done a good job putting the past behind it and the bank appears well positioned for success. But the near term could be choppy. We still don't know exactly when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease up on rates, and there are continued concerns about the health of the consumer and what it might mean for bank loan portfolios.\nFor long-term focused investors, the good news is Wells Fargo has the wherewithal to handle whatever happens from here.

Trading revenue was also up for all three institutions.\n\"We are happy to see the progress,\" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.\nStocks of all three banks fell, however, as higher interest rates and elevated deposit costs ate away at more traditional consumer banking margins. The banks also set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that they expect credit conditions to worsen.\nWhat attracted a lot of attention from investors Friday was more weakness in a key measure of lending revenue known as net interest income. It fell sequentially at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup as their customers continued migrating to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\nRead more: How CDs work and how to choose the right ones for you\nNet interest income is a central driver of profit for any bank because it accounts for the difference between what banks earn from their loans and pay out on their deposits.\nThis measure at JPMorgan declined 1% from the prior quarter. If not for an $8 billion one-time accounting gain tied to an exchange of shares in credit card giant Visa (V), JPMorgan\u2019s overall net profit would have declined 9% from a year ago.\nIts stock fell more than 1% Friday.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

Instead, the bank seemed more comfortable in a lower range, predicting it would fall between 8% and 9%.\nBut even Wells Fargo benefited from more Wall Street activity. Its investment banking revenues surged 38% to $430 million.\nAt JPMorgan, investment banking rose 50% from last year to $2.35 billion. At Citigroup, those fees jumped 63% in the second quarter to $935 million.\n'Green shoots'\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\nSo far this year, things are looking up despite lingering concerns about the path of inflation, geopolitical tensions, and an uncertain presidential election outcome.\nThe Wall Street performances of JPMorgan and Citigroup were also a good sign for other investment banking heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) that are due to report earnings next week.\nDespite the improvement, Barnum of JPMorgan was careful Friday not to get too excited as he cited potential headwinds. One potential barrier to new deals is an antitrust focus in Washington, which some market observers say is depressing deal activity.\n\"The dialogue on M&A is robust, I would say, a little bit more elevated,\u201d Barnum said. However, \"there's a little bit of a chilling effect on M&A because of the regulatory environment, and that remains the case.\u201d\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also offered some general caution in a press release, saying that \"while market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks.\"\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\nHe referenced geopolitical tensions and persistent inflationary forces, adding that \"inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.\"\nDimon did not attend JPMorgan\u2019s second quarter earnings conference calls with reporters or analysts Friday.\nThe reason given by bank executives: a travel conflict.\nThe bank\u2019s spokesman told reporters Dimon was flying back from Germany after helping to celebrate the bank\u2019s 100th anniversary in that country.\nThe bank CFO, Barnum, told reporters, \"It's a travel conflict, that's it. There's literally nothing more to it.\u201d\nBarnum said Dimon almost always attends the calls and \u201cthat should continue to be the expectation.\u201d\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/A-Wall-Street-Revival-Is-Carrying-Big-Banks-As-Main-Street-Struggles-112142298.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.1330864429, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "WFC", "Time": "2024-07-12T15:20:00.000Z", "Headline": "Wells Fargo's (WFC) Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Fee Income", "Summary": "Shares of Wells Fargo & Company WFC lost 5% in the pre-market session as investors expressed concern regarding the decline in the loan balance. Its second-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.33 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.25.\n\nResults benefited from higher non-interest income. An improvement in capital ratios and a decline in provisions were other positives. However, the decrease in net interest income (NII), as well as loan and deposit balances, and an increase in expenses were the undermining factors.\n\nNet income was $4.9 billion, which decreased marginally from the prior-year quarter.\nRevenues Improve and Expenses Rise\nQuarterly total revenues were $20.7 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.3 billion. Also, the top line increased nearly 1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s NII was $11.9 billion, down 9.4% year over year. The metric was affected by higher interest rates on funding costs and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. \n\nThe net interest margin (on a taxable-equivalent basis) declined year over year to 2.75% from 3.09%.\n\nNon-interest income grew 18.9% to $8.77 billion. The improvement was driven by higher trading revenues and increased investment banking and wealth management fees. This, along with the adoption of a new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, and improved results from the venture capital investments led to the rise. \n\nNon-interest expenses were $13.3 billion, up 2.4% year over year. This was mainly due to a rise in operating losses, improved revenue-related compensation and investment in technology and equipment, partially offset by the company\u2019s efficiency initiatives.\n\nWells Fargo's efficiency ratio of 64% was higher than 63% in the year-ago quarter. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates a deterioration in profitability.\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, total loans of $917.9 billion declined slightly on a sequential basis. Total deposits were $1.37 trillion, down 1.2% on a sequential basis.\nCredit Quality: Mixed Bag\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.24 billion, down 27.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nHowever, net loan charge-offs were $1.3 billion or 0.57% of average loans in the reported quarter, up 70.3% year over year. Further, non-performing assets jumped 23.2% to $8.65 billion.\nCapital Ratio Improves\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, the Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11% under the Standardized Approach, up from 10.7% reported in the second quarter of 2023.\nProfitability Ratio: Mixed Bag\nReturn on assets was 1.03%, down from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 1.05%. Return on equity of 11.5% increased from 11.4% year over year.\nShare Repurchase Update\nIn the reported quarter, Wells Fargo repurchased 100.5 million shares for $6.1 billion.\nOur View\nThe company\u2019s strong fee income growth is likely to support its top line in the upcoming period. Also, lower provisions and strong capital ratios are other positives. However, lower loan and deposit balances due to asset cap and an increase in expenses are major near-term concerns.\nWells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nWells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nWells Fargo & Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Wells Fargo & Company Quote\nCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Net interest income, which amounted to $11.9 billion for the quarter, refers to the difference between the interest a bank pays on deposits and the interest it collects on loans.\nWells Fargo expects its full-year net interest income to decline 7% to 9% from last year\u2019s $52.4 billion. The bank\u2019s second-quarter net income slipped about 1%, to $4.9 billion.  \nDuring a conference call with analysts Friday, Wells CFO Mike Santomassimo noted consumers are still moving their money from checking accounts into savings and certificates of deposit \u201cbut at a slower pace.\u201d Santomassimo said he expects further migration, but believes it\u2019ll continue to slow. \nOn the commercial side, the bank\u2019s deposit growth puts some near-term pressure on net interest income as Wells strives to remain competitive on pricing, but it\u2019s a long-term positive to have those deposits \u2014 especially once interest rate cuts occur, Santomassimo said.\nWells has also launched a number of new credit cards in recent years, one of CEO Charlie Scharf\u2019s initiatives when he joined the bank in 2019. After an analyst mentioned a recent Wall Street Journal article that reported the bank is losing millions every month on a co-branded credit card with fintech Bilt, Scharf sought to brush aside any concerns, deeming that program a \u201cvery, very, very small piece\u201d of the bank\u2019s overall credit card roster and noting bank executives are conscious of potential risks. \nAs Wells aims to reduce its reliance on net interest income, the bank has looked to its investment-banking unit for a boost. Higher investment-banking fees during the quarter helped fuel non-interest income\u2019s 19% jump, to $8.8 billion. The bank has pulled executives from JPMorgan Chase in recent months to help boost its corporate dealmaking and trading business.\nJPMorgan gets a boost from fees\nWith an uptick in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activity, investment banking also gave JPMorgan a lift during the quarter: The bank\u2019s fees generated from investment banking soared 50%, according to second-quarter earnings materials. \nAt JPMorgan, however, net interest income rose 4%, to $22.9 billion, driven in part by higher revolving balances on credit cards. The bank\u2019s CFO, Jeremy Barnum, said loan demand remains muted everywhere except in credit cards. \nFor Wells, office properties continue to drive commercial real estate losses, which increased in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter. In June, Santomassimo noted strain in the institutional office space, calling out older office buildings in some metro areas as those seeing the most stress.\nDeterioration in the CRE office portfolio drove up nonperforming assets about 5%, to $8.65 billion. However, \u201cthe portfolio is small, and the overall NPA rate is still only 0.9% of loans,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients.\nThe bank expects those CRE office losses to remain \u201clumpy,\u201d as it works with clients and tries to \u201cto de-risk our office exposure,\u201d Santomassimo said Friday. \nWells remains constrained by a $1.95 trillion asset cap tied to the 2016 fake-accounts scandal. The bank continues to make steady progress on improving its control environment, although Scharf noted it\u2019s up to regulators to decide when necessary work has been completed.\n\u201cThe industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions,\u201d he added.\nThis story was originally published on Banking Dive.
