On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) boarded the bank earnings train. Morgan Stanley topped profit and revenue estimates with its second quarter financials on the back of stronger-than-expected trading and investment banking performance. Bank of America also topped estimates with second-quarter revenue and profit that were fueled by rising investment banking and asset management fees.\nGoldman Sachs Justified The High Expectations\nOut of the six biggest banks,  Goldman is the most reliant on investment banking and trading to generate revenue and therefore, expectations were high with the rebound in Wall Street activity.  For the quarter ended on June 30th, revenue grew 17% to $12.73 billion on the back of core trading, advisory, as well as asset and wealth management operations, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s $12.46 billion estimate. Prrofit surged 150% YoY to $3.04 billion, or $8.62 per share; but last year\u2019s financials were dragged down by hamstrung by write-downs from commercial real estate and the sale of a consumer business.\nFixed income was one of the highlights with revenue jumping 17% to $3.18 billion, surassping StreetAccount\u2019s estimate by $220 million, along with the bank\u2019s shrinking exposure to consumer loans as provision for credit losses went down 54% to $282 million, which is quite below StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of $435.4 million. On other fronts, Goldman Sachs was mainly in line with estimates. Equities trading rose 7% to $3.17 billion based on strong activity in derivatives.\nAsset and wealth management division reported growth of 27% as revenue amounted to $3.88 billion. Platform solutions division reported revenue grew 2% to $669 million on the back of rising credit card balances and deposits.\nBut the well-known investment banking business disappointed compared to rivals as investment banking fees rose only 21% to $1.73 billion, slightly brlow StreetAccount\u2019s $1.8 billion estimate, with growth behind far behind rivals JPMOrgan Chase and Citigroup who have reported rises exceeding 50%. Goldman Sachs attributed the miss to weaker-than-expected advisory fees of $688 million.\nMorgan Stanley Benefited From Rebounding Wall Street Activity\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Morgan Stanley reported revenue grew 12% YoY to $15.02 billion, topping Wall Street\u2019s $14.3 billion estimate.\nWealth management revenue grew 2% to $6.79 billion, which was short of $6.88 billion estimate. Equity trading reported growth of 18% as revenue amounted to $3.02 billion, surpassing the StreetAccount estimate by about $330 million. Fixed income trading revenue grew by 16% to $1.99 billion, topping the Wall Street estimate by $130 million. Fueled by rising fixed income underwriting activity, investment banking revenue surged 51% to $1.62 billion, exceeding the estimate by $220 million.\nThe bottom line surged 41% YoY as profit amounted to $3.08 billion, or $1.82 per share, helped by a rebound in Wall Street activity..\nInterest income plunged 17% YoY to $1.79 billion as the rate environment pushed rich clients to continue shifting cash into higher-yielding assets, resulting in lower deposit levels. Earnings amounted to $1.82 a share, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $1.65 a share.\nMorgan Stanley investors value the more steady nature of the wealth management business due to its more predictable nature compared to investment banking and trading. However, its usual dynamic got flupped as institutional securities division earn more revenue compared to its wealth management division.\nBank Of America Promised A NII Rebound\nFor the June quarter, Bank of America reported revenue grew less than 1% to $25.54 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $25.22 billion. Profit slipped 6.9% YoY to $6.9 billion, or 83 cents a share, also topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of 80 cents.\nInvestment banking fees rose 29% to $1.56 billion while asset management fees grew 14% to $3.37 billion, and wealth management division reported a 6.3% revenue growth of $5.57 billion. Net interest income contracted 3% to $13.86 billion.\nBut net interest income fourth quarter guidance of $14.5 billion gave hope of a turnaround this year. Aided by this guidance, shares grew 5.4%.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only. It is not intended as investing advice.\nThis article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Inflation remains the top concern for investors (54%), followed by the 2024 election (34%), market volatility (22%), and a recession (20%).\nInvestors are skeptical on rate cuts. Less than half (48%) believe the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to cut rates this quarter, down from 51% last quarter.\nThough the majority believe cuts are on the horizon. 54% believe the Fed will cut rates in the second half of the year.\nAnd many believe the market will continue to rise before Q4. Over half of investors (59%) predict the market will rise by the end of the third quarter.\n\"It\u2019s understandable to see bullishness remaining steady this quarter as the market pushed higher driven by mega-caps,\" said Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. \"On the flipside, the narrow market could make some traders jittery especially when compounded by a higher for longer rate stance from the Fed. So, it\u2019s easy to see how investors can have mixed emotions about where we stand when it comes to the market and the economy.\"\nThe survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the third quarter of 2024:\nIT \u2013 Tech continues to take the leading spot for investor interest, as mega-cap tech names dominate, with the chips and AI space holding its ground.\nEnergy \u2013 As oil prices trended higher, positive views of energy stocks mounted this quarter.\nHealth care \u2013 Amid political and economic uncertainty, investors continue to look at health care\u2014a traditionally defensive sector, although interest dipped from the previous quarter by 2 percentage points as the market moved higher.\nAbout the Survey\nThis wave of the survey was conducted from July 1 to July 16 of 2024 among an online US sample of 891 self-directed investors, investors who fully delegate investment account management to financial professionals, and investors who utilize both. The survey has a margin of error of \u00b13.20 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. It was fielded and administered by Dynata. The panel is broken into three investable assets: less than $500k, between $500k to $1 million, and over $1 million. The panel is 60% male and 40% female and self-select as having moderate+ investing experience, with an even distribution across geographic regions, and age bands.\nAbout Morgan Stanley Wealth Management\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, a global leader, provides access to a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses and institutions, including brokerage and investment advisory services, financial and wealth planning, cash management and lending products and services, annuities and insurance, retirement and trust services.\nAbout Morgan Stanley\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

The longest portion of the offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.17 percentage point above Treasuries after initial discussions of around 1.4 percentage point, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\nProceeds from the offering will be used for general purposes and Morgan Stanley was the sole underwriter of the deal, added the person. A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\nThe sale came a day after the bank\u2019s trading business posted the biggest increase among its peers in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley, like its rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., beat expectations, solidifying the markets business as a hot spot across the industry.\nJPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman have raised a combined $16.5 billion after reporting second-quarter earnings.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.\nYour parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.\nYears ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.\nThat means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.\nAnd lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.\nUnfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?\nInvest in Dividend Stocks\nWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).\nLook for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.\nOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.\nHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.\nMorgan Stanley (MS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.93 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.2%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.19% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.53%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 9.68%. Check Morgan Stanley dividend history here>>>\nTanger (SKT) is paying out a dividend of $0.28 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.93% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.17% and the S&P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 12.24% over the past year. Check Tanger dividend history here>>>\nCurrently paying a dividend of $1.9 per share, Virtus Investment Partners (VRTS) has a dividend yield of 3.12%. This is compared to the Financial - Investment Management industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 15.15%. Check Virtus Investment Partners dividend history here>>>\nBut aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?\nIt is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.\nAn upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.\nThinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.\nIf you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.\nBottom Line\nPursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release.\nThis presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\nTed Pick\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. The firm generated $15 billion in revenue, $1.82 in EPS, and a 17.5% return on tangible in the second quarter. Solid earnings and demonstration of operating leverage completes a strong first half of 2024. $30 billion in revenue, $6 billion in earnings, and an 18.6% return on capital.\nIn institutional securities, we're beginning to see the benefits from our continued focus on our world-class investment banking franchise, with revenues up 50% year over year, including a 70% increase year over year in fixed income underwriting.\nIn institutional equities, we are back with a $3 billion quarter. In wealth, we posted margins of 27%. And across wealth and investment management, we've now grown total client assets to $7.2 trillion, on our road to $10 trillion plus. Together, we delivered strong operating leverage.\nFurther, on the back of the annual stress test results, we announced that we will increase the dividend by $0.075 cents for the third year in a row to $0.925 cents, reflecting the growth of our durable earnings over time.\nDuring the quarter, we built $1.5 billion of capital, and at quarter end, our CET1 ratio, is 15.2%, 170 basis points above the forward requirement. Our capital position provides us the flexibility to continue to support dividend growth, support our clients, and buy the stock back opportunistically.\nThe quarter also showed continued balance in both top line and profitability across the major segments. Wealth and institutional securities, produced $6.8 billion and $7 billion in revenue, respectively, with earnings also roughly split between our institutional businesses and wealth and investment management. Our businesses are working closely together to maximize adjacent opportunities across the integrated firm.\nAcross the investment bank, navigating changes in the cycle means being deliberate around risk management and given geopolitical uncertainty where we spend our time, to deliver clients solutions and to capture share.\nIn wealth management, we continue to focus on aggregating assets and delivering strong advice. In investment management, we are investing in secular growth areas, including customization and real assets. Year to date, annualized growth in net new assets and wealth management is over 5%, with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows.\nStrong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which on average continues to be about $100 million each day this year throughout and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise. We are well navigating the continued uncertainty around forward rate path, geopolitics, and now the US political cycle, and expect those to be the themes for the balance of the year.\nWe remain focused on our best-in-class talent and building out best-in-class infrastructure to support ongoing growth across wealth and investment management and institutional securities.\nI wanted to reiterate our strategy, which is clear, to advise individuals and institutions around the world in raising, managing, and allocating capital. World-class execution demands that we deliver strong earnings and returns through the cycle, that we do so while maintaining robust capital levels, and that we deliver on a durable growth narrative across the segments. And that Morgan Stanley executes on this strategy in a first-class way, blue. That's it in a nutshell.\nAnd finally, in reflecting on this weekend's assassination attempt, we share in the hope that in the months to come, we will, as Americans, find ways to unify and preserve our better selves.\nWith that, Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya\nThank you, and good morning. In the second quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15 billion. Our EPS was $1.82, and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results highlight the power and scale of our integrated firm. The resilience of the US economy and a more stable near-term outlook on rates supported conviction amongst clients.\nInstitutional securities drove performance, led by strength in equity and a pickup in investment banking. Wealth management also delivered on our established strategy, reporting record durable asset management fees and strong fee-based flows. Together, improved confidence and higher client engagement, along with our focus on prioritizing investments, yielded operating leverage and profitability.\nThe firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%, benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base. Year-to-date expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses, the absence of back-office integration-related costs and severance, as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend.\nOn prioritization, we remain committed to client and asset growth, technology, and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion increased 23% versus last year, capturing the strength of the integrated investment bank across US and international markets. Higher activity in Asia contributed to results. Strong performance in institutional equity, as well as debt underwriting, demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise. In our markets business, opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data.\nInvestment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. The 51% increase from the prior year was broad based. We continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending, broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors, including financials, healthcare, technology, and industrials. These investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up.\nAdvisory revenues were $592 million, reflecting an increase in our completed M&A activity versus the prior year. The pre-announced M&A backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors. Equity underwriting revenues of $352 million improved versus the prior year, driven by increases across most products, but remained below historical averages.\nFrom a geographical perspective, we brought a number of transactions to market in Europe and Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $675 million, well above five-year historical averages. Results reflect a meaningful increase in non-investment-grade loan and bond issuance, as tighter spreads and strong CLO issuance provided opportunities for refinancing.\nThe investment banking backdrop continues to improve, led by the US. The advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors. Inflation data has continued to moderate, which has helped stabilize front-end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor re-engagement.\nAs buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap, we expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. Subject to changes in rate pass expectations and geopolitical developments, our integrated investment bank is well-positioned to service our clients.\nTurning to equity. We continue to be a global leader in this business. Equity revenues of over $3 billion, up 18% compared to last year, reflect strong results across business and regions. Higher client engagement, dynamic risk management, and strength in Asia all contributed to performance.\nPrime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year, as client balances reached new peaks. Regionally, we witnessed higher client activity in Asia and seasonal patterns in Europe. Cash results increased versus last year, reflecting higher volumes across regions.\nDerivative results were up versus last year's second quarter, as client activity was higher, and the business navigated the market environment well. Further, the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances, additional evidence of the integrated firm at work.\nFixed income revenues of $2 billion increased year over year. Macro performance was up versus the prior year. Despite lower realized volatility, clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter. Micro results improved year over year, driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions. Solid results in commodities were in line with the prior year.\nTurning to ISG lending and provisions. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $54 million, driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs were $48 million, primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions.\nTurning to wealth management. Wealth management delivered strong results, generating revenues of $6.8 billion, with record asset management fees. Our PBT margin continued to make progress towards our goal, demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle. We are delivering on our differentiated, scaled, multi-channel asset gathering strategy. Wealth management client assets reached $5.7 trillion.\nMoving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Pre-tax profits was $1.8 billion, up year over year, with a reported margin of 26.8%. DCP negatively impacted our margin by approximately 100 basis points. The margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our asset gathering strategy. We are improving the efficiency with which we run our business.\nAsset management revenues of $4 billion were up 16%. That's more than $500 million in fees versus the prior year. That's driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows.\nIn the quarter, fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over $20 billion, bringing the year-to-date fee-based flows to $52 billion. We are seeing a steady migration of assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying off.\nFee-based assets now stand at $2 trillion. Net new assets were $36 billion, reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date net new assets are $131 billion, representing 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets.\nNet flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business-specific factors.\nWe believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high-net-worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still, our first-half NNA growth remains solid. Transactional revenues were $782 million. Excluding the impacts of DCP, revenues were up 5% versus last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity-related transactions.\nBank lending balances grew by $4 billion to $151 billion, evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes, our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs. Total deposits of $343 billion remain stable, with sweep deposits down approximately $10 billion sequentially, mostly offset by growth in CDs.\nNet interest income was down modestly to $1.8 billion, reflecting the decline in [sweep], which was largely attributed to the seasonality of tax payments. The wealth management business continues to perform well, aggregating assets, generating fees, and benefiting from scale in our differentiated offering, consistently earning approximately $100 million a day.\nIn the third quarter, we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics. The impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio. Therefore, third-quarter NII will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps, and NII could decline modestly in the third quarter.\nImportantly, inclusive of these pricing changes, the rate path, and our expectations around client behavior, we believe that NII should inflect higher as you look out into next year. Our wealth management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs, and offering advice. Asset management fees, the core of our wealth management strategy, continues to produce strong results, reaching a record this quarter.\nTaken together, we delivered a strong margin, and we continue to work towards 30% margins over time. This quarter, we reached approximately [19 million] in relationships across our three channels, and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement.\nAI tools are helping advisors grow, and wealth management's partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering. These investments have supported flows to our advisor-led channel, where average client duration is nearly 15 years and growing. The steady progress supports our journey towards $10 trillion plus in total client assets.\nTurning to investment management. Revenues of $1.4 billion increased 8% from the prior second quarter, supported by higher asset management revenues. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 6% year over year, reflecting higher average AUM. Total AUM ended the quarter at $1.5 trillion.\nPerformance-based income and other revenues were $44 million, as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure, US private credit, and US private equity funds, reflecting our investments in secular growth areas. We recorded long-term net outflows of approximately $1 billion. We continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus, namely Parametric.\nConsistent with current industry trends, we saw outflows in our active equity strategies. Our business is well-positioned, given strength in areas of secular growth, such as customization, direct indexing, and private alternatives. Our continued focus on global distribution, combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities, should support incremental growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $16 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%. Client activity was strong, and markets were open. We actively supported clients with a focus on velocity and competitive resources. We also grew our CET1 capital by $1.5 billion, reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution.\nThe most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position. For the third year in a row, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075 cents. Having generated over $3.85 of earnings per share, and an 18.6% ROTCE year to date, we entered the back half of the year from a position of strength, with a robust capital base to support clients.\nInvestment banking pipelines are healthy and diverse. Dialogues are active, and markets are open. In wealth management, strong fee-based flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working. As capital markets become more active, we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash and cash equivalent balances into fee-based products.\nWith that, we will now open the lineup to questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Glenn Schorr, Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr\nI appreciate all the upfront commentary on NII and wealth. I wanted to drill down a little bit on what you said. So if you have $2 trillion in client assets in advisory, and they keep a handful of percent of money in cash, that change you're making in rate paid on advisory -- on deposit and advisory accounts, can add up to like a good amount of money. So I wanted to get a little more sharper focus on what you said 2025 NII, and then what exactly did you say the offset is on the NII. Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya\nSure. Thanks, Glenn, for the question. Actually, the portion of the sweep balances that are impacted are, as you mentioned, the sweep on the advisor-led channel, which is actually a small portion of the overall BDP that we disclose. So it is a small portion of that overall stack, and the increase in pricing is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio. So as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices, it's that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead.\nGlenn Schorr\nOkay. And is there a particular reason why you only have to focus on repricing in this small portion of the advisor-led channel, meaning not for all?\nSharon Yeshaya\nCertainly. Yeah. What I would note there is that what we think about when we think about sweeps broadly is mainly in transactional accounts, and in those transactional accounts, we have a wide range of choices and products for our clients. And so therefore, they have a lot of options, as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage.\nOperator\nEbrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala\nMaybe sticking with NII and, more importantly, on pre-tax margins, right? You had an extremely strong quarter. The stock's weaker this morning, and it has to do with the NII drag on wealth, revenues, and margin.\nSo one, I think, Sharon, your level of visibility into NII, lots of moving pieces around client behavior, maybe we get interest rate cuts. Just give us a sense of if you see any guide on what rate cuts would imply for client behavior, or is there cash to assets that you're looking at that gives you comfort around NII potentially stabilizing post 3Q.\nAnd then, maybe for you, a question -- go ahead. Yeah.\nSharon Yeshaya\nYeah. So why don't I take that, and then you can ask your second question. So you are pointing out a great point, Ebrahim, as we look ahead through time, which was the second point of my guidance, is that when we look over the next year, we are seeing, and we expect that we should see an inflection in NII. And that is predicated on the points that you mentioned, which is that, as you see rate cuts, we would expect those balances to stabilize.\nRemember, outside of the tax quarter, this particular quarter, we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits. So it's important to recognize that that has been happening, reaching that frictional level of transactional cash. So that would likely continue. And then over time, you would also begin to see a benefit as rates were to be cut, that BDP could actually see inflows, which you've seen from a historical perspective.\nBut in addition to that, you have two other factors. One is the repricing of the portfolio, which I've also already mentioned. And the second piece has to do with lending. We look to continue to support our clients with lending products, and you're beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection. This is the first quarter that we've seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began.\nWe've seen now use of SBL products rather than just it being offset by paydowns. So those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for NII.\nEbrahim Poonawala\nThat's helpful. And I guess my second question was this -- talking to investors, when we look at the 30% pretax margin target, the question is whether this is aspirational, whether the bar is set too high, given how competitive the business is. So remind us in terms of your comfort level on that 30% pretax margin. And to the extent you can, the timeline of when we get there and when we get there, should that be a sustainable pace for the business? Thanks.\nTed Pick\nThanks, Ebrahim. Confidence level high. If you take a step back, there are three pieces to the wealth management line: asset management, transactional, net interest income, as you know. In the asset management context, those are fees that are going to fee-based accounts, advisory led. Those figures are up 4% sequentially and 16% year over year. That is fee-paying advice. Last quarter, the net new assets into that category was $26 billion. So fee-based flows, that continues to be a growth piece of the wealth management story.\nThe second cylinder is transactional. Transactional has been relatively weak, which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity. And as you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank, that will bleed through over time to the transactional line.\nAnd then third, the net interest income line. And as Sharon said, that will inflect and should inflect over the next year. You put those together, the scale of the business, the funnel, and the processing of $100 million of revenues a day that continue to grow, we are going to continue to achieve operating leverage.\nIt's that simple. We're investing in E*TRADE. We're investing in the traditional advisor. And we're spending a lot of time top of house, focused on workplace, which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base.\nIn January, I had said, 30% was the goal. We were in the mid-20s. We just printed 27% gap, 28% [ex-TCP]. It's a core stated objective. It will take some quarters to get there, but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business.\nOperator\nMike Mayo, Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo\nHi. Ted, you've said this, and Sharon repeated this, that the industry is only in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. I have to say, we've heard that for a couple of years. And now is this time -- why is this time real? Do you expect the rebound to continue through the normally slow summer period before the election? How many years? What gives you confidence that this is for real? How much is your backlog up quarter over quarter?\nTed Pick\nIt's an excellent question, because you're exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this, and it has been sort of a delayed shoots, if you will. But I think now we're seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates.\nWe're also beginning along with that to see the market broaden out. You, of course, have seen that over the last number of weeks. And I think we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken, whether that is across the corporate community or sponsors or other institutions. And the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product. Global convertibles activity is up significantly. And as you know, on the margin ladder, it typically goes converts, IPO, and then M&A.\nIn the context of bake-offs and the like, in some spaces we're seeing bake-offs running at triple plus the year-over-year rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups. We've been seeing now the launch of traditional IPOs, and we're seeing M&A pipeline kicking in. So corporate community, sponsor community, cross-border community, I think we're in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking-led cycle.\nIf you believe the economy is going to hold up, led by the US, you should expect then to see that if there's some regulatory normalization, too, across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active. So we are quite convicted on this call.\nMike Mayo\nAnd just one pushback. I mean, with interest rates so much higher than they've been in the past, don't you think that could get in the way when people are looking to borrow money for deals and the like? Is this a matter of simply waiting for rates to go lower? Or that's not going to get in the way?\nTed Pick\nI mean, it's a fair question. You've written about this in the context of, you know, what was the normal before financial repression. And I would take the view that in the context of the last 15 years, even some normalization, because I don't know that we're going to go into a full-blown rate cycle, to your point, some normalization of rates will still have you at 3% or 4% on the front end, and even some steepening, potentially.\nSo now we're just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of the mid-'90s and most normal economic periods. And the game will have to go on, because there's just been so much activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure or percentage of asset, of stock, percentage of market cap. And the stickiness that we're seeing in the sponsor community, too, needs to unglue.\nThere is an enormous, as you know, multi-trillion-dollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder that's been raised. That will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality, of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another.\nSo in short, unless you were to tell me we're going to go into full-blown recession, which none of us can call, and that even if we saw rates normalized to something that is along the lines of the historic 4% on the front end, I think you will see over the next number of quarters, and really over the next number of years, a resumption of more normalized M&A activity with the key difference being that the financial sponsor community is now institutionally come of age.\nThey have global reach. They can work the entire capital structure. They will work in concert with corporate partners, as you know. They don't actually have to act as lone wolves, and they can work with us to finance the package.\nSo it's not just the straight M&A advice or the straight IPO. It will also be bespoke offerings in the private-public space. It will also be bespoke offerings in the private-public space, interest rate and foreign exchange hedging and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring.\nAnd this is really why, over the last couple of years, to the extent we've done so-called front office hiring, it really has been to target several very high-quality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the Morgan Stanley platform, and we're seeing the fruits of that across industries.\nSo I am quite blessed. I am quite bullish on it, certainly take your point that it has been a number of quarters sort of on the promise. But I think as we get into 2025 and the election coming, and then the election behind us, we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace. *\nOperator\nDan Fannon, Jefferies.\nDan Fannon\nGood morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the flows in the quarter within wealth, maybe the breakdown from the channels and contribution. Last quarter, I think we saw family office being an outsized contributor, but hoping to get a little bit more color on where the flows were sourced in 2Q.\nSharon Yeshaya\nSure, I'll take that. It's, we continue to see broad-based sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from. In this particular quarter, as I mentioned, the biggest offset and drag, though, is really from taxes. So it's, you still have workplace accounts, you still have the advice-based account directly, you still have self-directed, all those places remain contributors.\nWhat continues in my mind to be most interesting, though, isn't just the contribution that you're getting from the three various channels. But the fact that you have in the advice-based channel, it's not just coming from existing clients, but it's split with existing and net new clients. And some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace.\nSo I would not just directly focus on what channel is it coming from, but how are you seeing those channel and that interplay work. Because that's actually the power of the differentiated platform. Once you have somebody who wants more differentiated advice from self-directed, speaks to an advisor, that advisor sees net new clients bring in assets, and then that's new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee based. So it's really the whole ecosystem that I would call your attention to, rather than just one isolated leg.\nTed Pick\nWhich is part of the reason that workplace is so important, because if workplace can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community, that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth and then potentially other products around it.\nSo it can be an indirect sale, where you aren't necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the FAA, but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace, where we do a great job educating on wellness, financial wellness, and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the Morgan Stanley Solium product. And having succeeded on an MS at work mandate, which, as you know, is a durable, sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base, you can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that firm.\nOperator\nBrennan Hawken, UBS.\nBrennan Hawken\nYeah, good morning, Ted. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just drill down a little more, give a second follow-up here on the repricing change that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Sharon. So the repricing that we've seen in the securities book has been slow.\nSo I'm just kind of curious as to why you think that will help offset the repricing actions that you're taking on the deposit side. Is that because it'll be a phased repricing, and therefore, there's an ability to have the phased benefit in the asset side offse. And then just a nitty-gritty question on it, is the switch going to be to money fund sweep rather than higher yielding deposits, and then that way you can just slowly replace that funding as you see fit?\nSharon Yeshaya\nSo thanks, Brennan. I'll take that question. No, all the changes that we'll make will happen -- are expected to happen in the third quarter. And so those different changes will be made, and they'll be based on various competitive dynamics.\nBrennan Hawken\nOkay, got it. And then is this going to be focused on the advisory relationship, similar to what we've seen from some other warehouse competitors? And could you just -- is it the changes that have recently been announced by Wells and BofA? Is that what you mean by competitive dynamics, or is there something else that I'm not aware of?\nSharon Yeshaya\nNope. That's exactly as I stated it, and it will just be limited, as you said, to the sweeps that are dealt with in the advisor-led channel.\nOperator\nDevin Ryan, JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan\nThe first question, just on -- another one on the GWM flows. Sharon, you mentioned tax season is a factor, which you completely get, but then you also mentioned increased client spending. And I just wanted to drill into that, just whether that's something that could continue, whether it was seasonal or influenced by inflation, just trying to understand that component of the impact on flows.\nSharon Yeshaya\nYeah, I think that's a really interesting question. I did call it out. We've seen increased spending by hundreds. We've seen increased spending by higher net worth. And so higher-income bands are certainly spending. We see that in the data alongside actual spending. We see that in purchases of homes. We see that in various tailored investments.\nSo they are -- that cohort, so to speak, is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways. So I too think that that's an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well. It's certainly something we're seeing in our data.\nDevin Ryan\nOkay. Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up just on the interplay between investment banking and trading, and appreciate the commentary on kind of the improving capital markets backdrop, which is great to hear and kind of the expectation from our end that there's going to be a lot more primary issuance and equities maybe in debt as well as M&A picks up.\nSo just trying to think about what that means for the trading businesses, equities and fixed income, and whether you guys feel like we could maybe sustain around these really high levels or even -- maybe even the wallet could move higher just as you get a stronger primary issuance market.\nTed Pick\nWell, I know that the competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset. Here, we have, we believe, something really special. Insight. We have an asset that's going to be part of our institutional securities business, our so-called integrated investment bank, which has been ongoing for now we're getting on seven or eight years now under Dan Simkowitz direction.\nAnd this is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income, equities, and banking through our capital markets new issue business. You have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another.\nSo there's real familiarity now with the work product. A lot of the work product, as you know, is not traditional vanilla IPOs. Yes, there are some on the horizon that are quite substantial, and we'd expect that to be an important part of the calendar. But there's also more bespoke product, whether it be convertibles or products in the private area or products that effectively necessitate high-quality structuring and advice.\nAnd that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have world-class investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues, not just in the new issue business, but as appropriate in institutional equities and in fixed income.\nAnd if you look at our fixed income business, for example, and fixed income underwriting, you'll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary and that the year-over-year revenue number, I believe, is up 71%. That speaks to a fine work that's been done by folks, not just in the debt capital markets business, which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking, but also working closely with fixed income professionals, whether they are in the securitized products group, in our commodities area, broader credit, or in our macro space, i.e., interest rate and foreign exchange.\nSo when you get into the knitting of ISG, our integrated investment bank, you see that part of the reason that we are bullish on, not just to Mike's earlier question on the denominator, but also on our ability to increase the numerator is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital.\nWe will do so as appropriate when the market's demanded, but that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that comes from the familiarity of our people, the quality of the advice that is differentiated. And importantly, that it's global, so that we can bring it to the client base.\nSo that is part of, I think, the secret sauce that we've been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns inside the investment bank on a standalone basis. And that obviously doesn't include even the synergies that we'd see across the firm into wealth and investment management.\nBut your question is on the investment bank specifically. Yeah. And I feel really good about the way it's structured, the leadership that we have within it, the experience set, and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle, which will be different than the last one.\nRates will be well higher than that of financial repression. We'll be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession. We'll be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle, US election cycle, but the world around us. But also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community, where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the investment bank, wealth, and investment management.\nOperator\nSteven Chubak, Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak\nSo maybe just starting off with a question just on operating leverage within ISG. Year to date, the incremental margins are quite strong, just north of 80%. You spoke constructively on IB and trading inflecting positively. Just want to better understand what you believe is a sustainable incremental margin as activity steadily builds, especially given some of the growth, at least from here, may skew a little bit more heavily towards investment banking, which tends to be more compensable.\nSharon Yeshaya\nSo when you look at it -- I would really focus, Steve, on the efficiency ratio targets that we've put for the whole firm. We think that the firm can run at or below the 70% over time through a durable cycle. The issue with your specific question, as you yourself highlighted, is it depends on where those different revenues are coming from. So there might be periods of time where it's higher [BCNA-related]. There might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it.\nBut broadly speaking, the enterprise, we've given 30% margins as it relates to wealth and the sort of wealth and investment management space, and then you have the ISG space. So by definition, if you're running at 70% efficiency ratio more broadly, you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a 30% margin.\nTed Pick\nYeah. The only thing I would add to that is, of course, as you know, there's real seasonality in the business. Fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter street-wide in the first quarter. Investment banking typically in the fourth quarter. That's not every year, but that's typically how it shakes out. Third quarter tends to be weaker in the summer months, and then it's sort of all about September. And obviously, this September will be one that will be driven in part by sentiment around the upcoming elections.\nSo that's kind of the seasonality piece. The other is just the scale within the businesses. I'd be remiss, again, not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached $3 billion in the equities business. This has been a leading business where we have been number one or number two for the last dozen years. And we see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash, derivatives, and prime brokerage. And then connecting to investment banking, I think that business has, too, hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute a high-margin business through the cycle.\nAll of this, of course, is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels. But given where we are right now, we're feeling good about that, too.\nSteven Chubak\nNo, thanks for that perspective. And just a follow-up on the deposit discussion. Both you and your Wirehouse peers announced similar actions on deposits, which you noted, Sharon. You mentioned it was informed by competitive dynamics. But I wanted to better understand if there was any feedback you or your peers had received from regulators that prompted the decision. Because from our vantage point, the timing of these pricing actions at this stage of the rate cycle is simply difficult to reconcile.\nSharon Yeshaya\nI'm sorry, Steve. We don't comment, as you know, on regulatory matters.\nSteven Chubak\nOkay. Fair enough. I had to try. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nGerard Cassidy, RBC.\nGerard Cassidy\nYou gave us good insights into your thinking about what the capital markets could bring, especially in investment banking. And I think you touched on in your comments with trends, or maybe you have, Sharon, that the transactional numbers could benefit from a stronger ECM business. Can you then take the next second derivative and share with us from your experience with [Solium]?\nShould we see that business pick up the workplace channel if more of these maybe private equity sponsor companies go public? Should the workplace channels see stronger revenues potentially? Revenues potentially in a stronger investment banking market over the next 12 or 18 months?\nSharon Yeshaya\nI think that's a great question. I know, Gerard, a few years ago you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is. I completely agree with you.\nAs you have workplace assets rise, the value of those client assets rise, new corporations issue their employees more stock. They also grow their employee base. It should absolutely add participants. It should add new corporates. It will add new net flows.\nAnd now that we have all of, you know, that when you just had Solium, now you also have E*TRADE and Workplace, and the platforms are integrated. So as those flows flow into an E*TRADE account, people can transact on that. And then as Ted said, we can also offer financial wellness. So absolutely, it helps that ecosystem begin to work.\nGerard Cassidy\nVery good. Very good. And just as a follow-up, Ted, if I take a step back, obviously, you guys have done a very good job in the last 10 years of growing organically, but then complementing that growth with acquisitions. Once we get the Basel III endgame final proposal, maybe some G-SIB relief, can you share with us, as you look out over the next two, three years, is there any parts of the picture today that you'd like to enhance possibly with acquisitions? Or are you a good way you are today?\nTed Pick\nI'll take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital, if I could, Gerard, and link that to potential external opportunities. We anticipated or believed it was possible that we could have a tougher annual CCAR test, and indeed it was. And what we've prioritized in potential uses of capital, above all, is that we've prioritized in potential uses of capital above all, things has been dividend policy.\nAnd as you know, we are increasing dividend again to $0.925 cents, which at spot offers a 3.5% current, 3.5% dividend yield. So that is the continued highest priority on use of capital, if you include, of course, use of capital to inorganic opportunity.\nSecond, our clients, we have continued to lean in for clients across the business segment, as appropriate, and you see the operating leverage across the businesses, particularly across the investment bank. But we've also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital this past quarter, more than $2 billion between the dividend and the buyback, in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality.\nAs we sit here today, we are 170 base points above the buffer. And importantly, we continue to be in the 3.0 G-SIB buffer, which in one context wouldn't normally get much attention, but does get attention in the context of your question, which is sort of forward-looking strategic opportunity. It's worth noting, if we can manage to stay at 3.0, assuming that the framework holds through whatever Basel brings, that will be our buffer in 2026.\nSo we're [170] over, and we accreted $1.5 billion this quarter. External, i.e. inorganic, therefore, is something we can think about. It's just not something we're going to think about in the short term. The reality is we've got our forced hierarchy. The forced hierarchy is dividend first, investing in clients as appropriate, achieving operating returns against that second. And then third, the buyback opportunistically.\nDown the road, two, three, four years out, if opportunities come across the horizon, importantly, after we have some definition around Basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside CCAR formulation, so just general regulatory uncertainty, sure, we might look at stuff.\nBut I would tell you in the short term, we're very happy with the acquisitions that we've made over the last 10, 12 years, and we are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments, wealth and investment management and the integrated investment bank, and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of 70% and the margins and returns that we've talked about.\nOperator\nSaul Martinez, HSBC.\nSaul Martinez\nSo I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on the outlook for your sales and trading businesses. You've kind of consistently done about $18 billion to $20 billion of annual revenue in post-pandemic period in FIC and equities. And right now, we have a backdrop where we're going to see rate cuts. Markets are strong. Issuance activity may pick up. At the same time, you have perhaps more competition from foreign banks who have lost share.\nSo how do you see -- do you have a view on how you see the wallet evolving for these businesses, your ability to maintain or gain share in this backdrop? And I guess ultimately, do you think you can grow revenues here from a base that is materially higher than what it was pre-pandemic?\nTed Pick\nYeah. I think the answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable. We want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base, whether it be the global asset managers, the leading alternative asset managers, private equity and private credit players that come to the fore, and then our lead corporate and sovereign clients.\nThere are products that can be offered. There are very few firms that can do that globally. We continue to have a world-class markets business, for example, in Asia, where I believe we have the largest equities business. We've been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent in the UK, where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention. And as you know, we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at MUFG in Tokyo.\nSo if you consider the global footprint of the firm, in a world that continues to be equities-based, it continues to be an equities world. You see it in the asset price momentum in the US. You see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors. And that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business, for example, where we've been very strong traditionally in equities, to do the cash, derivatives, and prime brokerage suite that we offer.\nYou could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the US, whether you'll see a steeper yield curve where you'll see activity on the front and to the belly of the curve. That of course offers all kinds of opportunities to the rates business and connected to corporate catalyst activity where, on an M&A acquisition, the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk, and that's a service that we offer.\nAgain, I like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank. I like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that, but that we're allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a once-in-every-few-years catalyst event that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand.\nSo the answer would be to grow and grow responsibly. I'd like to think we could inch up the numerator along with the denominator, and that you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years.\nSaul Martinez\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Just, I guess, a quick follow-up, related follow-up. The ROE, 14% in ISG in the first half of the year, early on, as you highlighted, in an investment banking cycle. Do you have a view on where the institutional securities ROE can get to as the investment banking cycle kind of plays out? Is there a view on sort of what a normalized ROE would be here?\nTed Pick\nWe're still early. We're still early in the cycle. We're watching it, of course. To the earlier question on when the green shoots come through on the high-margin M&A product, the reality of seasonality, the uncertainty of rate path, geopolitics, US elections. It's hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties, not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that we're dealing with as we speak, Basel, namely.\nBut yes, you're right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the investment bank, and over the course of a number of years, as we think about not just the integrated firm, but the returns generated inside of wealth and investment management. And then we look at the returns inside the investment bank, we are measuring that, and we're looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable 70% efficiency of the firm.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time.

Wells, which has been responding to Securities and Exchange Commission inquiries about its own cash sweeps, said it is raising its yields on uninvested cash. That move is expected to lower its Wealth and Investment Management unit's revenue by $350 million this year.\nSeparately on Tuesday, Bank of America announced that it's making pricing changes on certain deposits held in its Merrill wealth management arm. A Bank of America spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for elaboration.\nSweeping allegations\n\nThe term \"cash sweeps\" refers to brokerages' practice of taking clients' uninvested money held in brokerage and advisory accounts and moving it into internal and external banks. Those banks then pay interest in return for being able to use the cash as deposits that they can then lend out at higher rates.\nREAD MORE:\nMorgan Stanley clients got 0.01% on uninvested cash.

Much of the scrutiny centers on the question of whether advisors with a fiduciary duty to serve their clients' best interests shouldn't be placing their uninvested cash in better-paying alternatives. Critics of the policies often note that both money markets and high-yield savings accounts offer returns of around 5%.\nMorgan Stanley is the subject of two separate lawsuits questioning its cash-sweeps policies. A class action suit filed on June 14 in a New York federal court questions the firm's practice of offering returns as low as 0.01% on clients' uninvested cash. A separate class action filed in February in a New Jersey federal court alleges that cash held in retirement accounts was being swept into accounts paying unreasonably low interest rates. Bank of America's primary wealth management arm, Merrill, is meanwhile faced with its own suit about its cash-sweeps policies.\nOn Tuesday's earnings call, Yeshaya returned to the idea that the firm's sweep modifications were coming in response to \"competitive dynamics.\" She said the changes will most likely cost the firm some net interest income in its third quarter. Those losses, she said, will be offset partly by gains in its investment portfolio.\nShe said the sweeps changes will only affect uninvested cash held in the firm's advisor-led channel. The bulk of clients' free money is instead in transactional accounts, she said.\n\"And in those transactional accounts, we have a wide range of choices in products for our clients,\" Yeshaya said. \"And so therefore, they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage.\"\nA spokesperson for the firm declined to elaborate on her comments.\nWealth management results\n\nMorgan Stanley meanwhile reported that its intake of net new assets fell more than 60% in a quarter that nonetheless saw the Wall Street giant trudging toward its goal of having $10 trillion under management.\nAccording to its earnings release, Morgan Stanley brought in $36.4 billion in net new assets in the three months leading up to June 30. That was down 62% from the previous quarter and 59% from the second quarter of 2023.\nSpeaking with analysts Tuesday, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick noted that even if assets came in at a slower pace in the second quarter, the firm has nonetheless brought in $131 billion in net new assets so far this year.\n\"Year-to-date, annualized growth in net new assets in wealth management is over 5%, with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows,\" he said. \"Strong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which on average has been $100 million each day this year and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise.\"\nThe inflows helped push Morgan Stanley's client assets in its Wealth and Investment Management division to $7.2 trillion. That was up from $7 trillion in the previous quarter and showed slowing progress toward the firm's long-stated plan to eventually have $10 trillion under management.\nThe firm also reported progress on its goal of bringing its pretax margin for its wealth management unit up to 30%. That number, the proportion of revenue the division keeps after subtracting all expenses save taxes, rose by 1 percentage point to 27% in the second quarter.\nThat helped drive the unit's net income up by 7% year over year to $1.4 billion on nearly $6.8 billion in net revenue. For all of its business units, Morgan Stanley reported $3.08 billion in net income on $15 billion in revenue.\nClient assets\n\nThe firm's $7.2 trillion in assets was made up of $1.5 trillion in its investment management unit and nearly $5.7 trillion in wealth management. Of the wealth assets, just over $4.4 trillion was being managed by advisors, $1.25 trillion was held in self-directed E-Trade accounts and $452 billion was in the firm's workplace channel, which helps companies provide services like financial planning and equity compensation to employees.\nOf the assets managed by advisors, $2.2 trillion, or 49% of the total, was in accounts generating fees. That number was up 18% year over year.\nThe firm also reported having 6.6 million participants in stock plans offered through its Morgan Stanley at Work workplace channel. That figure was up 2% year over year.\nWealth profit and revenue\n\nOf the wealth unit's $6.8 billion in net revenue, nearly $4 billion came from managing clients' assets. That figure was up 16% year over year.\nYeshaya said in an earnings call that the firm's asset management fees, \"the core of our wealth management strategy,\" climbed to a record high in the quarter.\n\"Our wealth management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs and offering advice,\" Yeshaya said.\nThat was offset, though, by a 17% drop to $1.8 billion in net interest income, or NII. Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Evercore ISI, noted the NII figure was also down by 3% from the previous quarter.\n\"Seasonally softer net new asset growth and 3% quarter-over-quarter lower NII in wealth were the only real issues we saw,\" Schorr wrote in a note reported on by Bloomberg. \"Our gut is tax season is mostly to blame and the rest of results were pretty darn good amidst this improving capital markets backdrop.\"\nExpenses\n\nMorgan Stanley reported $4.95 billion in noninterest expenses from its wealth management unit, a figure up 2% year over year. Of that, $3.6 billion went to compensation and benefits, a number up 3% year over year.\nMorgan Stanley no longer reports how many advisors it has on staff. Its expenses related to compensation and benefits came to 53% of its net revenues for the quarter.\nRemark\n\nYeshaya said she and other executives believe the flow of net new assets was down primarily because clients were setting aside money in the second quarter to pay taxes.\n\"Net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business-specific factors,\" she said. \"We believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high net worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still, our first half (net new asset) growth remains solid.\"", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Following-Wells-Morgan-Stanley-Plans-190637086.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.0394795872, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}, {"Ticker": "MS", "Time": "2024-07-16T18:03:27.000Z", "Headline": "Morgan Stanley earnings, Trump VP, retail sales: Morning Brief", "Summary": "It's a new day, but the same old stock market.

Morgan Stanley, like its rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., beat expectations, solidifying the markets business as a hot spot across the industry. Investment-banking fees also increased, soaring 51% from a year earlier.\nStill, Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth unit, the firm\u2019s biggest growth driver in recent years, fell short of expectations, with $6.79 billion in revenue. Net new assets in that business, a key metric for Morgan Stanley watchers, totaled $36.4 billion, short of the pace needed for the bank to reach its annual target, while net interest income slumped.\nMorgan Stanley is trying to rev up enthusiasm for its stock, which has underperformed all its major competitors this year, by persuading investors it can meet ambitious goals for its wealth-management machine. Meanwhile, the bank is fighting for its share of an investment-banking revival that has been a boon to Wall Street businesses.\nShares of Morgan Stanley declined 0.8% to $104.45 at 9:43 a.m. in New York.

He had handed over the chief executive officer role to Ted Pick at the start of 2024.\nFixed-income trading was up 16% to $2 billion and the equity business climbed 18% to $3.02 billion. The combined gain outstripped the pace set at the other big US banks.\nThe firm earned $592 million in fees from advising on deals, while analysts had expected $523 million. Equity-underwriting fees came in at $352 million as a return of public listings and secondary offerings has raised banker hopes for a fuller reopening of those markets. Debt underwriting totaled $675 million.\n\u201cBacklog continues to improve,\u201d Yeshaya said. She also batted down the idea of the looming US election cutting into the revival in the dealmaking business. \u201cThere isn\u2019t evidence that it stops deals from happening or changes the calendar all that much.\u201d\nPretax margin in the wealth-management business, another closely watched metric, came in at 26.8% that was just behind estimates.

Our estimate for the same was $1.5 billion.\n\nNet revenues were $6.98 billion, up 23% year over year. The upside resulted from increased advisory fees, underwriting income and trading revenues. We had projected revenues of $6 billion.\n\nWealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.82 billion, up 8% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.89 billion.\n\nNet revenues were $6.79 billion, up 2%, driven by higher asset management revenues and transactional revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.78 billion.\n\nTotal client assets were $5.69 trillion as of Jun 30, 2024, up 16% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $5.41 trillion.\n\nInvestment Management: Pre-tax income was $222 million, jumping 31% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $276. million.\n\nNet revenues were $1.39 billion, up 8%. The improvement was largely attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees.

Bank of America expects net interest income to rise later this year as the Federal Reserve starts to lower interest rates and the bank replaces under-earning bonds and fixed-rate loans with higher-yielding assets.\nIt said it expected fourth quarter net interest income to be $600 million higher than its second quarter figure.\nAnd its Wall Street operations really stood out. Investment banking fees jumped 28% from a year ago while its equities trading rose nearly 20%.\n\"The fundamental trends have been strong capital markets and weak net interest income,\" Portales Partners founder Charlie Peabody told Yahoo Finance Monday, referring to the trends of bank earnings season thus far.\n\"The question is if that spread income is going to reflect positively in the second half of the year.\"\nInvestment banking fees and trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.\nBank of America's stock rose more than 5% Tuesday.

He said the bank is on track to reaching its goal of a 30% pre-tax margin in the wealth business, a key performance target.\nInstitutional securities revenue grew 23% in the quarter to $7 billion, buoyed by investment banking revenue, which soared 51% to $1.62 billion.\n\"We're in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking-led cycle,\" Pick told analysts on a conference call.\nChief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya reinforced his view, saying \"pipelines are healthy and diverse, dialogs are active, and markets are open.\"\nEquity underwriting revenue jumped 56% to $352 million, driven by a rebound in initial public offerings and private stock sales, while fixed income underwriting surged 71% to $675 million.\nAdvisory revenues climbed 30% to $592 million as the company closed more deals.\nPick was optimistic about Morgan Stanley's equity trading business, citing a key milestone of revenue exceeding $3 billion, growing 18% from a year earlier.\nThe company is investing in trading in Asia and the UK, he said, adding that macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties are creating opportunities for clients.\nRevenue growth in wealth management slowed to 2% in the second quarter, compared with a 16% jump a year earlier. Net new assets came in at $36.4 billion, below last year's $89.5 billion.\nNet income rose to $3.1 billion, or $1.82 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $2.2 billion, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.65, according to LSEG.\nMorgan Stanley said it would raise its quarterly dividend to $0.925 per share, up 7.5 cents. Dividend payments were the bank's highest-priority use of capital, Pick said.\nAnalysts were generally upbeat on the results, although some underscored weaker growth in wealth.\n\u201cMorgan Stanley\u2019s strong Q2 results were primarily driven by an industry-wide rebound in investment banking activity, while wealth and asset management remained steady contributors on the back of a robust equities market,\" said Mike Taiano, senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Ratings.\nThe earnings were a \"tale of two segments,\" with impressive results in institutional securities offset by a mixed performance in wealth, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken wrote.\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT SLOWS\nWealth management flourished under Morgan Stanley's former CEO James Gorman, generating stable revenue from fees when markets were volatile. He set a target of managing $10 trillion in client assets, which stood at $7.2 trillion in the second quarter.\nMorgan Stanley executives told analysts the wealth unit is growing within the bank's expected range of 5% to 7% annually, even as net asset inflows slowed.\nWhile the bank is not considering acquisitions in the short term, it could consider opportunities in two to four years, Pick said.\nGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported robust investment banking revenue.\n(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru and Tatiana Bautzer in New York; editing by Lananh Nguyen, Devika Syamnath and Rod Nickel)", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Morgan-Stanleys-Profit-Jumps-Investment-113258891.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.8537629247, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "MS", "Time": "2024-07-16T11:32:03.000Z", "Headline": "Midday movers: Bank of America, Match rise; Charles Schwab falls", "Summary": "(Updated - July 16, 2024 11:28 AM EDT)\nInvesting.com -- U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 gaining, while Nasdaq treaded water as investors shied away from megacap tech stocks.\nHere are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:\nBank of America (BAC) stock rose 5% after the lender reported second-quarter revenue and profit topping expectations on rising investment banking and asset management fees.\nMorgan Stanley (MS) stock rose 2.6% after the investment bank reported its profit rose in the second quarter with investment banking activity rebounding, as some of its peers had outperformed.\nCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) (SCHW) stock fell 7.3% after the financial services company reported results largely in line with expectations, failing to beat guidance like many of its peers.\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 0.1% after a report CEO Elon Musk planned to commit around $45 million a month to a new pro-Trump super political action committee.\nMatch (MTCH) stock rose 8% following a report activist investor Starboard has a stake of more than 6.5% in the Tinder owner and was pushing for a possible sale if a turnaround wasn't successful.\nTrump Media&Technology (DJT) stock fell 9.1%, pulling back after closing up 31% a day earlier amid a broader rally in the so-called Trump trade across markets.\nUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock rose 6% despite the health insurer raising its estimates for a hit to earnings this year from a February hack at its tech unit, as it rolls out loans to healthcare providers and records higher expenses from notifying affected customers.\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock fell 1% after analysts downgraded its investment stance on the big data analytics software maker to \u2018underperform\u2019 from \u2018neutral\u2019, saying its rich valuation is becoming \u201chard to justify.\u201d\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rose 7.6% after analysts upgraded its stance on the e-commerce platform to \u2018buy\u2019 from \u2018neutral\u2019, saying the \u201ccompany has turned a corner on balanced growth and margin, under new CFO Jeff Hoffmeister.\u201d\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock rose 1% despite analysts downgrading the coffee chain to \u2018in line\u2019 from \u2018outperform\u2019, saying soft trends are continuing.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) were down 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively, as investors sold high-flying, megacap tech stocks in favor of small caps names, with iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rising 2.3%.\n\nAdditional reporting by Louis Juricic\nRelated Articles\nMidday movers: Bank of America, Match rise; Charles Schwab falls\nPro Research: Wall Street dives into Boeing's flight path\nUnitedHealth expects bigger hit to profit from tech unit hack", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Bank-America-Tesla-Match-Rise-080849436.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.4495038688, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "MS", "Time": "2024-07-16T11:30:00.000Z", "Headline": "Morgan Stanley Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results", "Summary": "Morgan Stanley Reports Net Revenues of $15.0 Billion, EPS of $1.82 and ROTCE of 17.5%\nNEW YORK, July 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported net revenues of $15.0 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared with $13.5 billion a year ago.

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\n3 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results.\n4 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents tangible common shareholder\u2019s equity divided by common shares outstanding.\n5 \"DCP\" refers to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation programs. Please refer to \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Other Matters \u2013 Deferred Cash-Based Compensation\" in the Firm\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n6 Pre-tax income represents income before provision for income taxes.\n7 Pre-tax margin represents income before provision for income taxes divided by net revenues.\n8 The expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues.\n9 Wealth Management fee-based client assets represent the amount of assets in client accounts where the basis of payment for services is a fee calculated on those assets.\n10 Wealth Management fee-based asset flows include net new fee-based assets (including asset acquisitions), net account transfers, dividends, interest, and client fees, and exclude institutional cash management related activity.\n11 Wealth Management net new assets represent client asset inflows, inclusive of interest, dividends and asset acquisitions, less client asset outflows, and exclude the impact of business combinations/divestitures and the impact of fees and commissions.\n12 AUM is defined as assets under management or supervision.\n13 Long-term net flows include the Equity, Fixed Income and Alternative and Solutions asset classes and excludes the Liquidity and Overlay Services asset class.\n14 Transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues.\n15 Capital ratios are estimates as of the press release date, July 16, 2024.\n16 CET1 capital is defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The Firm\u2019s risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (the \"Standardized Approach\") and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the \"Advanced Approach\").

These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related customer receivables and payables that are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current and previous presentation of these interest income and interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in accounting principle. These changes were applied retrospectively to the income statement in 2023 and accordingly, prior period amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n\u2013\nFirm net revenues excluding mark-to-market gains and losses on deferred cash-based compensation plans (DCP) were: 2Q24: $15,073 million, 1Q24: $14,949 million, 2Q23: $13,343 million, 2Q24 YTD: $30,022 million, 2Q23 YTD: $27,707 million.\n\u2013\nFirm compensation expenses excluding DCP were: 2Q24: $6,405 million, 1Q24: $6,447 million, 2Q23: $6,084 million, 2Q24 YTD: $12,852 million, 2Q23 YTD: $12,301 million.\n\u2013\nThe End Notes are an integral part of this presentation.

Thus, the company\u2019s trading numbers are likely to have provided some support to its quarterly results, slated to be announced before the opening bell on Jul 16.\n\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, the likelihood of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, gradually cooling inflation and clarity on the interest rate path drove client activity. While volatility was low in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange, Morgan Stanley is likely to have recorded growth in trading revenues, supported by increased client activity.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.61 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $2 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 16.6%.\n\nOur estimates for second-quarter equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.60 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively.\nOther Key Factors at Play\nInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Following the weakness in 2022 and 2023, global mergers and acquisitions witnessed a rebound in the second quarter of 2024. Both deal value and volume witnessed a remarkable comeback, driven by solid financial performance, fading recession risks, buoyant markets and expected rate cuts this year. Yet, tough scrutiny by antitrust regulators and lingering geopolitical tensions were headwinds.\n\nThus, Morgan Stanley\u2019s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have offered support to advisory fees in the quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $498 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 9.5%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $488.7 million, indicating a 7.4% rise.\n\nThe IPO market activity was decent in the second quarter, given the impressive equity market performance. This also drove solid activity in follow-up equity issuances. Further, bond issuance volumes were boosted by lower yields, a better operating backdrop than last year, election-related uncertainty and a resurgence in M&As. Hence, Morgan Stanley\u2019s underwriting fees are expected to have improved in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $490 million, suggesting a rise of 24.1% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $363 million indicates an increase of 61.3%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $853 million implies a rise of 37.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\n\nOur estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $451.7 million, whereas the same for equity underwriting fees is $296.1 million.\n\nThus, growth in total IB income is likely to have been impressive, driven by the expected rise in underwriting revenues, as well as advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.43 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 32.8%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.24 billion.\n\nNet Interest Income (NII): Given the clarity on the Fed\u2019s interest rate path for the year and the likelihood of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, the lending scenario improved in the second quarter. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans was decent in the quarter.\n\nHowever, as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady in the quarter (at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%), Morgan Stanley is less likely to have recorded significant improvement in NII. Also, the inverted yield curve in the June-ended quarter and high funding costs are expected to have weighed on NII growth.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $1.91 billion, suggesting a decline of 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $1.83 billion, implying a dip of 9.2%.\n\nExpenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the June-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have been elevated.\n\nWe expect second-quarter total non-interest expenses of $10.34 billion.\nWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts\nAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

Morgan Stanley expects to post revenue of $14.3 billion. It posted $13.08 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nOn July 9, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken maintained Morgan Stanley with a Neutral rating. Hawken also increased the price target from $100 to $105.\nWith the recent buzz around Morgan Stanley, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Morgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 3.27%. That\u2019s a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a share ($3.40 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Morgan Stanley, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Morgan Stanley's $3.40 dividend: $6,000 / $3.40  = 1,765 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $183,719 worth of Morgan Stanley, or 1,765 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $3.40 = 353 shares, or $36,744 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on MS\nAlso Read: Top 4 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Rocket Higher In July\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nMS Price Action: Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 0.5% to close at $104.09 on Friday.\nRead More:\nAround $10M Bet On This Tech & Telecom Stock?

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

The Initial Conditional Tender Offer will be for up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s then-outstanding common shares at 98% of NAV per share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the date the tender offer expires.\nIf the conditions of the First Trigger Event are met, then additional terms and conditions of the Initial Conditional Tender Offer will be set forth in the Fund\u2019s offering materials filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will be distributed to the Fund\u2019s common shareholders, and in additional press releases, as applicable.

Trading revenue was also up for all three institutions.\n\"We are happy to see the progress,\" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.\nStocks of all three banks fell, however, as higher interest rates and elevated deposit costs ate away at more traditional consumer banking margins. The banks also set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that they expect credit conditions to worsen.\nWhat attracted a lot of attention from investors Friday was more weakness in a key measure of lending revenue known as net interest income. It fell sequentially at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup as their customers continued migrating to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\nRead more: How CDs work and how to choose the right ones for you\nNet interest income is a central driver of profit for any bank because it accounts for the difference between what banks earn from their loans and pay out on their deposits.\nThis measure at JPMorgan declined 1% from the prior quarter. If not for an $8 billion one-time accounting gain tied to an exchange of shares in credit card giant Visa (V), JPMorgan\u2019s overall net profit would have declined 9% from a year ago.\nIts stock fell more than 1% Friday.\nThe decline in net interest income at Wells Fargo was deeper than analysts anticipated, helping to push its stock down 6%.\nSeveral analysts hoped Wells Fargo might offer a higher revision to its net interest income guidance for the full year. Instead, the bank seemed more comfortable in a lower range, predicting it would fall between 8% and 9%.\nBut even Wells Fargo benefited from more Wall Street activity. Its investment banking revenues surged 38% to $430 million.\nAt JPMorgan, investment banking rose 50% from last year to $2.35 billion. At Citigroup, those fees jumped 63% in the second quarter to $935 million.\n'Green shoots'\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\nSo far this year, things are looking up despite lingering concerns about the path of inflation, geopolitical tensions, and an uncertain presidential election outcome.\nThe Wall Street performances of JPMorgan and Citigroup were also a good sign for other investment banking heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) that are due to report earnings next week.\nDespite the improvement, Barnum of JPMorgan was careful Friday not to get too excited as he cited potential headwinds. One potential barrier to new deals is an antitrust focus in Washington, which some market observers say is depressing deal activity.\n\"The dialogue on M&A is robust, I would say, a little bit more elevated,\u201d Barnum said. However, \"there's a little bit of a chilling effect on M&A because of the regulatory environment, and that remains the case.\u201d\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also offered some general caution in a press release, saying that \"while market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks.\"\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\nHe referenced geopolitical tensions and persistent inflationary forces, adding that \"inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.\"\nDimon did not attend JPMorgan\u2019s second quarter earnings conference calls with reporters or analysts Friday.\nThe reason given by bank executives: a travel conflict.\nThe bank\u2019s spokesman told reporters Dimon was flying back from Germany after helping to celebrate the bank\u2019s 100th anniversary in that country.\nThe bank CFO, Barnum, told reporters, \"It's a travel conflict, that's it.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\nBased in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 12.21%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.85 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.25% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.81% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.57%.\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 28.06%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, MS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.81 per share, with earnings expected to increase 24.73% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sales fell 4% for the year to the end of March, and it looks like demand in the key market of China will continue to weaken,\u201d IG said.\nShares in Burberry are down by more than half over the past year, to take them back to levels last seen in 2010.\nCompared to its five-year average PE of 17 times earnings, Burberry now looks cheap at 11 times earnings. IG analysts warned that while the dividend yield is a solid 7%, investors should be aware that the payout may be cut should the group\u2019s sales outlook continue to worsen.\nFor the year to March 2025, analysts currently expect sales to drop 6% to \u00a32.8bn.\nTSMC (TSM) \u2014 Reports quarterly update on Thursday 18 July\nThe AI craze has pushed Nvidia as other Magnificent 7 stocks to new heights but there is no AI without chips. And they are (almost) all being manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC.\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s key tech giant clients such as Nvidia and Apple have almost nowhere else to turn for next-gen chip manufacturing.\nTSMC\u2019s anticipated order for next-generation two-nanometer technology will be a key catalyst in the second half, according to Citi analysts, who see AI and sovereign investment adding upside to the company\u2019s 2030 revenue target of \u20ac44bn to \u20ac60bn, Bloomberg reported.\nThe Taiwan-based silicon giant disclosed in its latest monthly revenue report that net income for June was NT$207.87bn billion ($6.4bn), an increase of 32.9% compared with a year ago.\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\nFigures for May and April were NT$229.62bn ($7.04bn/) and NT$236.02bnn (\u00a35.41bn/$7.24bn), both up on the same period last year. TSMC is projected to grow sales by roughly 21% in FY24 and FY25.\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor is one of the most straightforward buy-and-hold options in all of technology alongside the likes of Nvidia and others because chips are the lifeblood of the economy and TSM is the semiconductor manufacturer,\u201d according to Zachs Research.\n\u201cAny near-term pullback down to some of Taiwan Semiconductor stock\u2019s key shorter-dated or longer-dated moving averages could mark a screaming buy signal for long-term investors,\u201d Zachs\u2019 analysts added.\nNetflix (NFLX) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 18 July\nSynonymous with streaming services, Netflix will show investors how it is fighting to stay on top and prove it can keep attracting new subscribers amid fierce competition.\nNetflix expects its revenue to increase 16% year-over-year (YoY) to $9.49bn (\u00a37.3bn) in the second quarter of 2024 but analysts predict Netflix's Q2 revenue will be slightly higher at $9.53bn. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix's revenue was $9.37bn, up 15% from the prior year.\nMorningstar equity analyst Matthew Dolphin provides a guide to what investors should focus on. \u201cWe're most interested in details on Netflix's ad-supported service, especially regarding how the firm is coming along in monetising it, as well as an update on the size of the ad-supported user base,\" he said.\n\u201cGenerally, we'll be looking to see if subscriber growth is slowing substantially after Netflix passed the tailwind from its password-sharing crackdown, and whether it will stop regularly disclosing this metric in 2025.\n\u201cWe will also be interested in international sales and subscriber growth. This will be a key driver for the company when/if domestic growth slows,\u201d he wrote.\nAs AJ Bell writes, Netflix no longer gives specific guidance for quarterly net subscriber additions, although co-chief executive officers Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos did suggest at the first-quarter stage that net adds would come in below the first quarter\u2019s bumper 9.3 million (the best first quarter since the pandemic and lockdowns in Q1 2020). That took the total subscriber base to a fraction under 270 million, up from 233 million in Q1 2023 and 167 million before the pandemic swept the globe.\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is also keen to look at subscribers: \u201cOne thing to watch for is the number of new paid subscribers in the second quarter. Management has already warned it\u2019ll be lower quarter-on-quarter due to the normal seasonal demand patterns. These have been a little skewed in recent years, but looking at 2018/19 numbers, net new subscribers were down 34% and 70% respectively across the first and second quarters \u2013 so don\u2019t be surprised to see something in that range.\n\u201cBest in class content is one of the reasons Netflix has been able to consistently deliver sector leading churn rates. It\u2019s expensive, but Netflix remains the only company set to increase content spend, giving a comparative advantage versus legacy media and its challengers.\u201d\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 15 July\nRobert Walters (RWA.L)\nOrkla (ORK.OL)\nGoldman Sachs (GS)\nBlackRock (BLK)\nTuesday 16 July\nOcado (OCDO.L)\nIntermediate Capital (ICG.L)\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\nMcBride (MCB.L)\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\nNCC (NCC.L)\nUnitedHealth (UNH)\nBank of America (BAC)\nMorgan Stanley (MS)\nOmnicom (OMC)\nWednesday 17 July\nRenold (RNO.L)\nHVIVO (HVO.L)\nBHP (BHP.L)\nASML (ASML)\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\nSvenska Handelsbanken (SHB-B.ST)\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\nCSX (CSX)\nUS Bancorp (USBC.VI)\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS)\nCitizens Financial (CZFS)\nUnited Airlines (UAL)\nAlcoa (AA)\nBank OZK (OZK)\nThursday 18 July\nSSE (SSE.L)\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\nKier (KIE.L)\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\nABB (ABBNY)\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\nVolvo (VOLV-A.ST)\nEQT (EQT)\nPublicis (PUB.PA)\nNokia (NOK)\nVolvo Car (VOLCAR-B.ST)\nSKF (SKF-B.ST)\nAbbott Labs (ABL.MU)\nBlackstone (BX)\nDR Horton (DHI)\nTractor Supply (TSCO)\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\nInterpublic (IPG)\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\nAlaska Airlines (ALK)\nFriday 19 July\nBridgepoint (BPT.L)\nSchindler (SHLRF)\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\nSaab (SAABBS.XC)\nElectrolux (ELUXY)\nAmerican Express (AXP)\nSchlumberger (SLB)\nHalliburton (HAL)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Anglo-American-Burberry-Tsmc-Netflix-Stocks-Watch-152336310.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.0132057853, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}, {"Ticker": "MS", "Time": "2024-07-12T15:11:59.000Z", "Headline": "US Consumer Sentiment Falls to Eight-Month Low on High Prices", "Summary": "(Bloomberg) -- US consumer sentiment unexpectedly declined to the lowest level in eight months in early July as high prices continued to weigh on Americans\u2019 views of their finances and the economy.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump \u2018Fine\u2019 After Being Shot In Ear at Rally, Shooter Is Dead\nMusk Donates to Trump, Tapping Fortune to Swing 2024 Race\nCanada Said to Have Mapped Out Secret Chinese Police Operations\nGiuliani\u2019s Bankruptcy Dismissed With $150 Million Still Owed\nBiden Self-Belief Collides With Democrat Angst in 2024 Struggle\nThe sentiment index fell to 66 in July from 68.2, according to the preliminary reading from the University of Michigan. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight increase to 68.5.\nConsumers\u2019 expectations for inflation over the next year fell for a second month, to 2.9%, data Friday showed. They saw costs rising at an annual rate of 2.9% over the next 5 to 10 years, also edging down from the prior month.\n\u201cDespite expecting inflation to ease, consumers remain vociferously frustrated at the persistence of high prices,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. \u201cAlmost half of consumers spontaneously expressed complaints that high prices are eroding their living standards, matching the all-time high reached two years ago.\u201d\nThe University of Michigan also released a special report on inflation expectations, a point of recent concern among economists. It found a divergence between average and median long-run expectations was driven by a small number of consumers and \u201cunlikely to reflect a fundamental deterioration in consumers\u2019 inflation expectations.\u201d\nData earlier this week showed inflation cooled broadly in June, with a measure of underlying price trends posting its smallest advance since 2021. That bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interests rates in coming months.\nWhile a separate report Friday showed a firmer-than-expected rise in wholesale inflation, details of the report pointed to underlying softness in the Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Capital Economics shaved their estimates for core PCE after the PPI release.\nThe recent downward path for inflation has provided some welcome relief to consumers who felt squeezed by the post-Covid spike in inflation. Goods prices have led the way, actually declining over most of the past year.\nAt the same time, the labor market, which has powered consumer spending, has showed signs of cooling, a trend that could help dampen sentiment if it continues.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this investment bank have returned +9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.81 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +24.7%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 indicates a change of +10.7% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\n12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $57.77 billion and $60.76 billion estimates indicate +6.7% and +5.2% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $2.02 for the same period compares with $1.70 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.6%. The EPS surprise was +19.53%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The yen\u2019s relentless weakening is increasing speculation that the BOJ will take further steps to normalize monetary policy soon, and major investors including life insurers are showing reluctance about parking their money in the debt.\nAdding to the market\u2019s bearishness, foreign investors sold Japanese medium- to long-term bonds on a net basis last week for the fourth consecutive week, matching the longest streak in about a year, according to Ministry of Finance data released Thursday. They also sold the most 10-year JGB futures in a month in the last week of June.\nThe yen\u2019s slide to near fresh 38-year lows against the dollar is prompting some traders to bet that the BOJ will reduce bond buying and raise interest rates at the same time at its July 30-31 policy meeting, to support the home currency.

The company's earnings report is expected on July 16, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.66, showcasing a 33.87% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $14.23 billion, indicating a 5.74% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.83 per share and revenue of $57.84 billion. These totals would mark changes of +25.09% and +6.83%, respectively, from last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.1% lower. Morgan Stanley is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nLooking at valuation, Morgan Stanley is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.03. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.96.\nWe can also see that MS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Financial - Investment Bank industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.16.\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 70, which puts it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

The state, which needs funds to help cover an expected budget shortfall resulting from an ambitious economic diversification plan, has accounted for more than half of the total debt sold by Saudi entities this year.\nAramco is a big part of the kingdom\u2019s cash flow plans. In June, the Saudi government offloaded a stake in the company that eventually brought in $12.35 billion, while the company\u2019s massive dividend payouts \u2014 the biggest in the world \u2014 also help fill state coffers.\nAramco maintained its $31 billion quarterly dividend to the Saudi government and other investors in May despite lower profit. Its free cash flow \u2014 funds from operations minus capital expenditure \u2014 of $22.8 billion in the period was less than the total payout.\nAramco sold its first dollar bond in 2019, and followed it with a 50-year debt offering in 2020. It issued dollar-denominated Islamic notes in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe company hired banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and SNB Capital to manage the latest bond sale.\nAramco is likely to use the funds to refinance existing borrowings and contribute to its investment program. The company is expanding natural gas production at home including $25 billion of contracts for the Jafurah project. It\u2019s spending billions to maintain oil output and pursuing acquisitions overseas, including tapping into LNG supply in the US and agreeing to take a share in an automotive joint venture.\nChief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed said in February that the company would sell long-dated debt this year as financial markets improve and the company looks to boost leverage on its balance sheet. The plan to issue long-maturity bonds shows Aramco is confident it can remain relevant well past the middle of the century even as the energy transition raises questions over future oil demand.\n--With assistance from Olivia Raimonde and Archana Narayanan.\n(Adds final pricing and order book in the second and third paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nHow Digital Money Really Works\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Saudi-Aramco-Kicks-Off-First-080218892.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.0282020569, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}]}
