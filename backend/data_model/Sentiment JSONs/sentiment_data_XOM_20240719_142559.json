During the first nine months of last year, Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) FCF came in at $28.1 billion. Out of that, just $11.1 billion were paid in dividends. Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) payout ratio is just 46%, which means it\u2019s spending for business growth, a healthy sign.\nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2024, 81 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM).

XOM is a leading integrated oil and natural gas company. It has upstream assets that develop and produce oil and natural gas, along with downstream refining and chemical manufacturing assets. We believe it has attractive low-cost acreage in the Permian basin and has a sizeable growth opportunity in Guyana. Further, we think XOM has a sustainable competitive advantage due to size and scale, and its ability to integrate refining and chemical assets provides a low-cost advantage versus competitors.\nOur thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per year through 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\nOverall, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 9 Best AI Energy Infrastructure Stocks to Buy Now.

Exxon, which operates all output in the South American country with a 45% stake in a lucrative consortium, has challenged the merger in which Chevron would gain control of Hess and its 30% stake, a deal that would define Chevron's future.\nExxon asserts that Hess should have first given it the opportunity to purchase its stake in the Guyana asset.\nExxon's position is that the right of first refusal is triggered by a change of control in Guyana and that Chevron structured the deal in a way to bypass it, people familiar with the arguments, which are confidential, said.\nChevron and Hess say the acquisition is structured in a way that would keep Hess intact, with no change of control of its asset in Guyana, since Hess would become a unit within Chevron.\nChevron and Hess believe the argument has no merit because Hess would survive under a new Chevron and continue to own the asset, people close to their thinking said.\n\"The crux here is whether a change of control even occurred,\" agreed oil and M&A expert James English at law firm Clark Hill Law.\nThe three-person arbitration panel which will make the call must decide in part whether to focus on the language in the contract or to delve into Chevron's intent.\n\"A plain language approach would be very favorable to Chevron, while if you go with the intent, Exxon may have a case,\" English said.\nA discussion around intent also would unfold the dispute into new stages that could require discovery, interrogations and hiring independent valuation experts, pushing a resolution into next year, as Exxon has warned.\nChevron believes the discussion on how to interpret the words in the contract will be \"very straightforward,\" a person aware of the company's legal strategy said. Chevron and Hess said they are seeking a hearing in the third quarter, hoping for an outcome in the fourth and to close the deal shortly thereafter.\nThe case is unique as Guyana represents between 60-80% of the $53 billion Chevron offered for Hess, English and other experts have estimated.\nAn Exxon arbitration win would not be the end of the dispute. While Exxon has ruled out buying Hess outright, it has left the door open to bid for its 30% stake in Guyana, to bid for just a piece of it, to get a compensation from Chevron, or to just leave things as they are.\nIts final strategy will depend on what is so far a closely guarded secret by Chevron and Hess: how much their merger values Hess' Guyana stake.\nOIL RICHES\nGuyana will produce 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the next decade, more than twice the output of OPEC-member Venezuela and nearly as much as the Gulf of Mexico, Rystad Energy consultancy firm projects.\nChevron originally hoped to close the Hess acquisition by the first half of this year, but was taken by surprise in March when Exxon sought arbitration over the right of first refusal.\n\"Job number one is to get past the first hurdle, which is an alignment that a preemption rights exist in the contract,\" Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Reuters in March.\nThe arbitration panel will analyze a confidential joint operation agreement (JOA) between Exxon, Hess and a third partner, CNOOC, that rules the Guyana operations, known as the Stabroek oil block.\nExxon wrote the JOA in 2008 with a previous partner, before any oil discoveries, based on a 2002 model contract by the Association of International Energy Negotiators (AIEN), two of the people said.\nThe model says, for instance, that any \"direct or indirect\" change in control would constitute a change in control but is not entirely clear on what indirect means.\nThe model language, however, has been adjusted. Exxon, Chevron and Hess declined to disclose the final language of the contract.\nThe model was updated in 2023 to make it explicit that there is change of control if the ultimate parent company changes.\n\"We wrote the JOA, so we have a pretty clear line of sightness (sic) to the intent and the circumstances that apply,\" Woods said in April after reporting first quarter earnings. \"That is the point of the arbitration.\"\nThe person aware of Chevron's strategy said that there is no real precedent for Exxon's change of control arguments in decades of industry mergers and acquisitions governed by similar JOAs.\n\"We disagree with Exxon Mobil\u2019s interpretation of the agreement and are confident that our position will prevail in arbitration,\u201d Hess said.\n(Reporting by Sabrina Valle; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Analysis-Exxon-Clash-Chevron-Hinges-100248306.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.5703008175, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "XOM", "Time": "2024-07-17T16:09:55.000Z", "Headline": "Chicago gas prices could soar after tornado narrowly misses refinery", "Summary": "Gas prices could soon soar across the Chicago metropolitan area after a tornado narrowly missed a major ExxonMobil refinery outside of Chicago Monday night, knocking out power to the facility.\nThe refinery, know as ExxonMobil\u2019s Joliet Refinery, is located in neighboring Channahon, Illinois.

The outage led to a flaring incident on Monday night, adding to the operational challenges faced by the refinery.\nThe storm, which brought heavy wind and rain to the area, resulted in widespread power outages, affecting thousands, according to National Weather Service. The Joliet refinery, a significant player in ExxonMobil's portfolio, processes Canadian crude oil and is crucial for producing gasoline and diesel, generating approximately 9 million gallons daily. The sudden loss of power not only halted these operations but also posed potential risks to the refinery's equipment and systems.\nRecovery from such situations typically takes time, as the sudden shutdown might have caused damage to some of the units. The assessment and recovery process involves thorough inspections to ensure that no critical component was compromised during the abrupt shutdown.\nXOM has neither commented on the incident nor provided an estimated timeline for the refinery's return to normal operations.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\nAlso read:\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise. The total amount of these dividend increases reached $20.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.8 billion in Q2 2023.\nDividend growth stocks are a hit with investors because they have rock-solid businesses, a steady cash flow, and strong balance sheets. These companies are top-notch for generating passive income. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy.\nOur Methodology:\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron\u2019s, and Business Insider. From their latest articles, we gathered the stocks they collectively favored. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database.

However, there are plenty of other dividend-paying energy companies to consider.\nTwo that stand out today are Equinor (NYSE: EQNR), down 15% year to date, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), down 3% so far this year. Both companies pay attractive dividends and are worth buying now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nEquinor's outsized profits have been a boon for income investors\nExxonMobil and Chevron have paid and raised their dividends annually for an impressive 42 years and 37 years, respectively.\nIn contrast, Equinor's dividend history is a little more complicated. The Norwegian oil and natural gas giant slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share at the end of 2019 to $0.09 per share at the start of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic took a sledgehammer to its cash flow.\nHowever, Equinor cashed in on the oil and gas recovery over the last few years \u2014 booking record revenue, net income, and free cash flow in 2022. Equinor's relatively low capital expenditures and inexpensive cost of production helped amplify its gains. Equinor's performance dipped in 2023, but its results were still excellent.\nBy late 2021, Equinor had raised its ordinary dividend back up to $0.20 per share, and it had begun to pay \"extraordinary\" dividends as well that were based on the performance of the company. These extraordinary payouts started at $0.20 per share \u2014 lifting Equinor's total dividend above its pre-pandemic level \u2014 and rose as high as $0.70 per share in Q3 2022.\nEquinor paid out a whopping $2.90 per share in dividends in 2022, and $3.40 per share in 2023. For 2024, Equinor plans to pay a $0.35 per share ordinary dividend and a $0.35 per share extraordinary dividend each quarter. That would add up to $2.80 per share for the year, giving it a forward yield of 10.5% based on the current stock price of $26.71.\nEquinor is a uniquely conservative oil major. It has been careful about ramping up production or making splashy acquisitions in the oil patch because of its aggressive energy transition goals. Equinor is 67% owned by the Norwegian state, and its management is heavily influenced by Norway's climate action targets. Over the long term, Equinor's oil and natural gas production will likely decrease, and its renewable energy investments will go up. By 2030, the company plans to allocate more than half of its annual gross capital expenditures to renewable energy projects and low-carbon solutions.\nEquinor's approach to the dividend makes sense within the context of its long-term goals to support a green and sustainable energy future. Instead of accelerating its fossil fuel investments, Equinor is using its profits from oil and gas to pay large dividends and fund its energy transition plan. Equinor would be a good fit for your portfolio if you want a high-yield stock and agree with the company's strategy.\nConocoPhillips jumps aboard the M&A train\nConocoPhillips is one of the largest U.S. exploration and production companies by market capitalization. Like Equinor, ConocoPhillips has its own climate targets, but those longer-term carbon-reduction goals are not stopping it from significantly ramping up oil and natural gas production over the medium term.\nThe company increased production by just 2% year over year in the first quarter. But production is about to surge once it completes its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO). That deal is a bet that oil and natural gas prices will stay at moderate levels. If all works out as hoped, ConocoPhillips will generate a boatload of free cash flow that it can use to pay down debt, accelerate growth, or increase its dividend.\nLike Equinor, ConocoPhillips has implemented a dual dividend program with an ordinary dividend and an extraordinary dividend. Its ordinary dividend currently sits at $0.58 per share quarterly, while its most recent extraordinary dividend was $0.20 per share. Annualized, that gives ConocoPhillips a yield of 2.8%, which is good, but far lower than Equinor's.\nIn October 2022, ConocoPhillips paid an extraordinary dividend of $1.40 per share. But since then, it has been paying far lower dividends, and with good reason. The company's value proposition to shareholders is based on long-term free cash flow growth, not maintaining a stagnant business and passing along profits. As such, its dividend is merely one aspect of the investment thesis. The bigger draw is the company's growth, which could lead to a strong stock price performance, higher future dividends, and share buybacks.\nConocoPhillips is the perfect energy stock if you're confident in mediocre to moderate oil and natural gas prices and growing U.S. energy exports. The company believes it will be able to buy back $20 billion of its stock over the next three years, which would offset most of the $22.5 billion all-stock transition for Marathon Oil. If all goes according to plan, ConocoPhillips will emerge with a more attractive asset base, higher production, and essentially no dilution to existing shareholders.\nChoose the path that's best for you\nWhile the short-term performance of energy stocks can be heavily dependent on oil and natural gas prices, their long-term performance can vary wildly based on management objectives and strategic execution. Comparing Equinor to ConocoPhillips highlights two starkly contrasting ways of pursuing growth. Equinor is gradually decreasing its focus on fossil fuels and shifting toward a more balanced portfolio of fossil fuel and renewable assets. In contrast, ConocoPhillips is focused on free cash flow and growth.\nThe best way to approach the energy sector is through a company that aligns with your outlook on the industry. If you believe that oil and natural gas aren't going anywhere for a while, then you may agree that now is the time for energy companies to generate a lot of free cash flow and grow their businesses, and then accelerate energy transition investments in the future.\nThere's also the ExxonMobil approach, which involves increasing oil and natural gas production and making low-carbon investments with an emphasis on profitability.\nIn sum, the best stock for you will depend on your risk tolerance, your view of the energy transition, and whether you want to invest in a company that is prioritizing high dividend payments now or is charting a path toward higher payments in the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Equinor Asa right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Equinor Asa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Equinor Asa wasn\u2019t one of them.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Exxon Mobil (XOM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nExxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.95, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.95 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 52.4% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for XOM\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for XOM\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Exxon here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Exxon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in XOM?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Exxon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 4.3% over the past month to $8.92.\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Exxon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Exxon with a grain of salt.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The discovery named Hammerhead is part of the prolific Starbroek Block offshore Guyana. The development of the Hammerhead discovery involves drilling up to 30 wells, per ExxonMobil\u2019s development plan.\nThe Hammerhead project is estimated to come online by 2029, pending government approval. The oil and gas giant expects daily production from the Hammerhead field to lie in the range of 120,000-180,000 barrels of crude. The Hammerhead project is anticipated to raise the production capacity of Guyana to approximately 1.4 billion barrels per day.\nExxonMobil has proposed the use of a Very Large Crude Carrier conversion facility for its seventh oil project in Guyanese waters.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Exxon Mobil's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\nView our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exxon Mobil is:\n16% = US$34b \u00f7 US$213b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nA Side By Side comparison of Exxon Mobil's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE\nAt first glance, Exxon Mobil seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 18%. This probably goes some way in explaining Exxon Mobil's significant 35% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nWe then performed a comparison between Exxon Mobil's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 38% in the same 5-year period.\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is XOM worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether XOM is currently mispriced by the market.\nIs Exxon Mobil Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\nExxon Mobil's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 29%, meaning the company retains 71% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Exxon Mobil is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.\nBesides, Exxon Mobil has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 43% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.\nConclusion\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Exxon Mobil's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

However, amid the latest data showing signs of easing inflation, many analysts believe possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve could reignite the market's interest in income stocks.

This article will look at some of the most popular dividend stocks among notable billionaires. We analyzed the latest portfolios of top billionaires, including Warren Buffett, Ken Fisher, Israel Englander, Steve Cohen, and Cliff Asness. We identified five dividend stocks commonly held across these influential investors\u2019 portfolios.\nCoca-Cola\nCoca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) has 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. Its resilient business makes the stock a defensive play when times are tough. The stock yields about 3% as of July 11, 2024. Some of the famous billionaires with stakes in the beverage company include Warren Buffett ($24.5 billion), Ken Griffin ($539 million), Ray Dalio ($384.74 million), and Steve Cohen ($325.04 million).\nCoca-Cola shares are up 5.4% so far this year. The latest industry data from Nielsen showed that Coca-Cola\u2019s market share remains strong. During the 12 months ending May 18, Coca-Cola sales jumped 4.1% year over year, much higher than the beverage industry's average growth of 1.1% during the same period.\nChevron\nWhat sets Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) apart from other dividend stocks is this: legendary investor Warren Buffett is the biggest stakeholder in the company, with an eye-popping $19.4 billion. But if you need more reasons to be impressed with the oil company, the list of billionaire shareholders is long. The stock is in the portfolios of Cliff Asness, Ken Griffin, Israel Englander, and Louis Bacon.\nChevron has an over 4% dividend yield and 36 years of consecutive dividend growth history. Chevron is a cash-rich company that returns value to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Last year, the company made headlines when it announced a $75 billion share buyback plan.\nExxon Mobil\nWith a 3.3% dividend yield and over 40 straight years of dividend growth, oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is loved by income investors. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, billionaire Ken Fisher had a $3.1 billion stake in the company. Meanwhile, billionaire Steve Cohen held a $259 million stake via his fund Point72 Asset Management. Other billionaire stakeholders in ExxonMobil include Ken Griffin, Cliff Asness and D.E. Shaw. Earlier this year, ExxonMobil completed its $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources.\nAnalysts expect the deal to help ExxonMobil reduce oil and gas production costs. During the first quarter alone, the company generated about $8.2 billion in earnings and $14.7 billion in cash from operations, while its structural cost savings surpassed $10 billion. This strong cash position and an expected upbeat demand for oil and gas make XOM a strong dividend player in the industry.\nWhole Foods' landlord has delivered a 15% net IRR for its investors since 2015. Check out the latest investment opportunities added to its platform.\nProcter & Gamble\nConsumer goods company Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the favorite dividend stocks of billionaires. The company has hiked its dividend for 68 straight years. The list of billionaires having stakes in the company is long: Ken Fisher (over $2.67 billion), Ray Dalio ($666 million), D.E. Shaw ($151 million), Israel Englander ($51 million), and Cliff Asness ($256 million), among others. Procter & Gamble shares have gained about 11% this year. Despite inflation, the company remains in a strong pricing position, as it's behind household names like Gillette, Old Spice, Oral B, and Pampers. Wall Street expects a 6% to 7% annual EPS growth for the company over the next two years.\nJohnson & Johnson\nWith 62 years of consecutive dividend increases, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the most famous and sought-after dividend stocks. Among the notable billionaire hedge funds having stakes in the company as of the end of the first quarter include Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management (over $1 billion), Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates (about $450 million), and Cliff Asness' AQR Capital ($382 million), among several others. Johnson & Johnson shares have been down about 6% this year, and the stock's forward P/E ratio is 14.17, much lower than the sector median of 18.7. While litigation-related headwinds have taken a toll on the stock, analysts believe the company's diversified revenue stream and strong cash position make it a safe dividend stock for the long term.\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

Given the election uncertainty and growing macroeconomic concerns, it will be hard for the market to repeat that performance in the second half.\nMany dividend stocks enjoyed even stronger first-half returns, including NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). While they'll likely face similar second-half headwinds as the broader market, they stand out to a few Fool.com contributors because they could deliver an encore performance in the second half.\nNextEra Energy rebounded in the first half\nReuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): Although NextEra Energy is a utility, it somehow managed to provide investors with a total return of just over 18% in the first half of 2024. That soundly beats the S&P 500 index's total return of roughly 15%. That said, NextEra Energy's price performance really represents a bounce back after rising interest rates led to a steep price decline. So investors probably shouldn't go in here thinking that a utility stock is going to shoot to the Moon.\nAnd yet there's something unique about NextEra Energy that will still attract investors: dividend growth. Over the past decade, the company's dividend growth has averaged around 10% a year. That's a good number for any company, let alone a utility. But here's the thing -- management is calling for dividend growth of 10% through at least 2026, backed by annual earnings growth of between 6% and 8% through 2027. So in this way NextEra Energy should be just as rewarding in the future for dividend growth investors as it has been in the past.\nThe key to the story is that Wall Street knows NextEra Energy is a dividend growth stock. It prices the shares accordingly, usually at a premium to other utilities. But so long as the dividend keeps growing at a rapid clip, the shares are likely to remain strong performers. The price drop that occurred when rates rose was based on the fear that dividend growth would be curtailed. Since that's not the case, it's reasonable to expect this dividend growth machine to keep on chugging along.\nLots of momentum heading into 2025\nMatt DiLallo (Targa Resources): Shares of Targa Resources rocketed in the year's first half, surging 48.2%. That crushed the S&P 500's 14.5% gain over the first six months of 2024.\nSeveral factors fueled Targa's big move. The pipeline company reported record adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the first quarter, driven by record volumes in the Permian and for liquefied petroleum gas exports. Its growing earnings and free cash flow gave the company the fuel to return more cash to investors. It announced a monster 50% dividend increase in the first quarter. The company also repurchased $124 million of its stock in the period.\nTarga still has a lot more growth coming down the pipeline. The company completed a new expansion project in May. It also secured two more projects, which it expects to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2026. They will add to the backlog of projects the company expects to complete in the coming months. Those expansions should continue driving its earnings and cash flow higher over the next few years.\nThe midstream company is about to hit a major inflection point. Targa Resources expects its total capital spending to decline from a range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion this year to around $1.4 billion in 2025 as its current wave of capital projects enter service. That will supply it with about $1 billion of incremental free cash flow next year. The company could use that excess cash to buy back more shares and continue boosting its dividend.\nWith momentum building for 2025, Targa could continue to deliver market-crushing returns in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\nThis oil giant keeps growing\nNeha Chamaria (ExxonMobil): After ending 2023 with barely 2% gains, ExxonMobil stock surged 15% in the first half of 2024, mirroring S&P 500 index gains. Rising crude oil prices, a big acquisition, and strong growth projections propelled shares of the oil and gas giant higher in recent months. ExxonMobil stock rose the most during the first few months of 2024 and hit all-time highs in April, also a period when crude oil prices rebounded sharply.\nEarlier in the year, ExxonMobil delivered industry-leading earnings of $36 billion and as much in free cash flow for 2023. It distributed $32.4 billion among its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, with 2023 also marking ExxonMobil's 41st year of consecutive dividend increases.\nExxonMobil's 2023 earnings, however, were lower compared with 2022, and that trend continued into the first quarter, with its Q1 earnings dropping nearly 28% year over year. That partly explains why the oil stock has cooled down a bit since late April, but investors overall remain focused on ExxonMobil's growth prospects.\nThe oil giant took a massive growth leap in May by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock deal worth $64.5 billion. The acquisition more than doubles ExxonMobil's footprint in the Permian Basin and is expected to be immediately accretive to its earnings and cash flows. Those higher earnings and cash flows should start reflecting in ExxonMobil's upcoming quarterly numbers and help the stock maintain momentum for the rest of the year.\nExxonMobil's stock, in fact, should keep humming beyond 2024 given management's expectation to more than double its earnings potential and nearly double its cash flows by 2027 versus 2019 at a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel.\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

ExxonMobil\u2019s claim of a right of first refusal over Hess\u2019 prized assets in Guyana has triggered a prolonged legal process, complicating the timeline for regulatory approval.\nHess, a key player in Guyana's lucrative Stabroek block, alongside ExxonMobil and China's CNOOC Ltd, owns a crucial 30% stake in the venture. The partnership is aimed at doubling oil and gas production to 1.3 million barrels per day by 2027. Despite these ambitious growth plans, the unresolved arbitration poses uncertainties for Hess's strategic initiatives in the region.\nHess and Chevron had initially aimed to conclude the merger by the first half of this year. However, with the FTC's review now expected to extend into the latter half of 2024, the timeline remains uncertain, pending the resolution of the arbitration dispute.\nHess stated that the arbitration process is advancing, with hopes of resolving by the end of 2024. Despite ExxonMobil's indications that the proceedings could stretch into 2025, Hess is optimistic about concluding the legal dispute this year.\nThe FTC's decision to delay its verdict on the merger until the arbitration case is settled, potentially as late as the fourth quarter, poses further challenges for Chevron and Hess. This regulatory scrutiny is part of broader antitrust measures impacting major deals within the oil sector this year, reflecting the FTC's rigorous approach to consolidations that could influence market dynamics.\nAs both companies await the commencement of the arbitration panel's review, which is expected to outline proceedings soon, the outcome remains pivotal for the future trajectory of Hess and its merger ambitions with Chevron.\nWhile the Chevron-Hess merger promises substantial synergies in the global energy landscape, regulatory hurdles and legal complexities underscore the arduous path toward its realization. The resolution of the arbitration with ExxonMobil stands as a critical determinant in shaping the timeline and viability of this landmark consolidation in the oil and gas sector.\nZacks Ranks & Other Stock to Consider\nHess currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at another top-ranked company mentioned below.

The \u2018white gold\u2019 is an essential ingredient in a laundry list of clean energy technology components, most notably the lithium-ion batteries used in electrical vehicles and for short-term energy storage \u2013 an essential stop-gap for variable renewable energy production.\nJust last month, ExxonMobil inked a preliminary deal to provide lithium to South Korean electric vehicle battery manufacturer sk On. Just months before that, the firm began drilling for lithium extraction in Arkansas. And according to Exxon insiders, this is just the beginning. ExxonMobil\u2019s Dan Holton recently told the Economist that a \u201cmaterial\u201d part of the $20 billion that the oil supermajor has earmarked for low-carbon investments between 2022 and 2027 will go directly to the lithium sector. \u201cBy 2030 the company hopes to produce enough lithium to supply 1m electric vehicles a year,\u201d the Economist reports.\nThough lithium prices have stumbled lately, this dip hasn\u2019t seemed to spook investors, as lithium is expected to generate high rates of return for its investors as clean energy manufacturing giants around the world scramble to shore up supply chains while the green energy transition heats up. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that lithium demand for battery-making alone is expected to increase by a factor of ten over the decade between 2020 and 2030. A 2023 report from Popular Mechanics calculated that \u201can electrified economy in 2030 will likely need anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes of lithium.\u201d To put that sum in perspective, \u201cIn 2021, the world produced only 105\u2014not 105,000\u2014tonnes.\u201d\nPolitics aside \u2013 money talks. And whether or not Big Oil is ready to give up the ghost of fossil fuels, they are ready to jump into the deep end of lithium production. \"What we're seeing right now in lithium is the sentiment is bearish,\" Exxon's Lithium Global Business Manager, Patrick Howarth, told Bloomberg in an interview on the sidelines of the Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Battery Raw Materials Conference in Las Vegas. \"We know the world urgently needs significantly more lithium than it's producing today.\"\nAs such, companies are looking to get into lithium from a number of angles, including opening up new mines, extracting the valuable element from the oil and gas industry\u2019s wastewater, and squeezing more revenue out of lands already owned by these firms where oil and gas have long since run dry.\nPutting the formidable weight of Big Oil behind lithium production in the West could have major implications for global clean energy markets. Currently, the market is all-but monopolized by China. Beijing alone controlled nearly ten percent of global lithium reserves and a whopping 72% of lithium refining capacity as of 2022. And Xi Jinping\u2019s government is hard at work inking more and more lithium supply deals in emerging countries around the world, and in South America\u2019s so-called \u2018lithium triangle\u2019 in particular.\nThe United States has been trying to break into the South American lithium market for years now, but has hit significant hurdles posed by China\u2019s already considerable presence and mistrust of dealmaking with the United States. The United States government has also put considerable funds into ramping up domestic lithium production, notably in Utah. Indeed, the Biden administration has offered more than $407 million for domestic exploration and production of lithium through the Inflation Reduction Act. But there is still only one functioning lithium mine in the country, and other prospective projects are still fledgling and woefully inadequate to stand up to China any time soon.\nBut if oil supermajors, with all of their bargaining power, deep pockets, and long arms of corporate influence, get increasingly involved in lithium production in the United States, this could provide the West with a much more even playing field in the clean energy competition with China.\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nKazakhstan\u2019s Surprise Tax Increase Shakes Up Global Uranium Market\nIndia and Russia Deepen Trade Ties Despite Ukraine Conflict\nWill China's Central Bank Cut Rates to Boost Sagging Economy?\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Big-Oil-Quietly-Investing-Lithium-210000174.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.1633452028, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "XOM", "Time": "2024-07-11T19:44:14.000Z", "Headline": "Three Energy Stocks to Buy as the Summer Heat Cranks Up", "Summary": "This summer is set to be a record breaker \u2013 with multiple heatwaves already impacting millions of people across the U.S. \u2013 even though we are still at the start of July. The weather has been so extreme that, tragically, people have passed away due to the heat this year.\nThe heat will naturally cause a spike in demand for energy-centric companies as more people use air conditioners in order to cool down, which is why today, I\u2019ll be talking about three energy companies you should invest in. The influx in demand comes at a crucial stage for all of these companies. If you want to crank up the magnitude of your returns, consider scooping up the shares of these three energy companies.\nTesla (TSLA)\nTesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is primarily an EV company but has recently started to expand far beyond just vehicles. It is developing the \u201cTesla Bot,\u201d an AI-powered robot. Additionally, it has also rapidly expanded Tesla Energy. TSLA\u2019s energy division has seen rapid growth recently, making it an intriguing energy play for investors.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIn terms of quarterly revenue growth, TSLA has seen a reduction of -8.7% YoY, with a reduction of -55.1% in earnings YoY. The profit margin is sitting at 14.37%, with a lower operating margin of 5.50%. This reduction is drastic, but investors are bullish for multiple reasons, and this reduction is likely already priced in.\nTSLA has seen rapid growth in its valuation over the last few weeks; it is up over 50% over the last month, with investors being bullish on different concepts such as Robotaxi. However, it is important to note the impact of its energy segment, with Morgan Stanley increasing its price target for TSLA primarily based on the sector. This is for good reason; in Q2 2024, it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage, which is a record for the company, but pails in comparison to what is expected soon. This came as the company missed vehicle delivery targets, making it an important catalyst for investors to consider and weigh.\nExxon Mobile (XOM)\nExxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\nExxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) is a premier crude oil and natural gas explorer and extractor. While it is based in the U.S., it operates all over the world, with many of its investments being international. Earnings are coming on July 26th, and as analysts are expecting lower earnings, the stock has slipped over the last month.\nIt\u2019s currently trading at a price of $113+ and is up almost 1% over the last month. The company has reported troubling earnings lately, by missing estimates in three of the last four quarters. Quarterly revenue is down 3.5% over the last year, with earnings down 28.1% over the same period. This is due to volatility in global energy prices, with has significantly impacted the margins XOM has.\nHowever, there are reasons to be bullish, especially for the long run. Due to expectations sliding before earnings are released, a miss will already be priced in \u2013 to a certain extent. Additionally, a new director bought $2 million worth of XOM, which is a significant bullish move and carries a heavy impact. Additionally, investments in international locations for the purpose of oil/natural gas explorations indicate the company\u2019s commitment to increasing the stream of supply it has.\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\nNextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a leading clean energy company specializing in renewable power generation, operating wind, solar, and natural gas facilities, and providing electricity through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light.\nNEE stock is currently trading at ~$75, with a market cap of about $154 billion.

The agency plans to announce its decision when the arbitration is finished, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing an internal agency matter.\nThe delay is yet another blow to the embattled deal, which is still far from completion nearly nine months after it was announced in October. The agency has made second requests for information for several large deals in the oil sector this year.\nThe FTC declined to comment. In separate statements, Chevron and Hess both said they expect to complete the agency\u2019s review process during the third quarter.\n\u201cWe continue to expect to complete the FTC review process during the third quarter,\u201d Hess said in a statement.\nUnless companies have an explicit timing agreement with the FTC, the agency has discretion on when to announce its decisions.\nShares of both companies fell on the news, pairing earlier gains. Hess was up 0.2% at 2:30 p.m., after earlier being up as much as 1.1%. Chevron shares were up 0.2%, after rising 1% earlier.\nThe FTC allowed Exxon\u2019s takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. to move forward after alleging Scott Sheffield, Pioneer\u2019s founder and former CEO, colluded with OPEC officials and blocked him from serving on the Texas oil giant\u2019s board. Sheffield rejected the claims.\nChevron\u2019s agreement to buy Hess, its biggest deal in two decades, has faced several hurdles, leaving both companies in strategic limbo.\nIn March, Exxon, which discovered and operates Guyana\u2019s Stabroek Block, accused Chevron of attempting to \u201ccircumvent\u201d its right to buy Hess\u2019s 30% stake in the 11 billion-barrel oil field. Chevron and Hess rejected the charge, saying Exxon\u2019s right doesn\u2019t apply because the deal is structured as a corporate takeover rather than an asset sale.\nBut the case went to arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, a process that could take until the fourth quarter at the earliest. Exxon\u2019s CEO Darren Woods has warned it could take longer.\nIn May, Hess investors approved the Chevron takeover by a razor-thin majority of 51% after several large shareholders and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. argued the vote should be delayed until after the arbitration case. The investors expressed concern that they would not receive Chevron dividends until the deal is complete, eroding the value of the transaction.\n--With assistance from Mitchell Ferman.\n(Adds company comments in fourth paragraph; updates shares)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nHe\u2019s Starting an Olympics Rival Where the Athletes Are on Steroids\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Ftc-Delays-Chevron-Hess-Decision-154717912.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.5195825696, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "XOM", "Time": "2024-07-11T18:48:26.000Z", "Headline": "Chevron and Hess say US FTC merger review expected for third quarter", "Summary": "By Sabrina Valle\n(Reuters) -Oil producers Chevron Corp and Hess Corp expect the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will review their proposed merger in the third quarter, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.\nBloomberg News reported earlier on Thursday the FTC planned to delay its decision on whether to block Chevron's $53-billion takeover of Hess until after an arbitration case with Exxon Mobil is settled, or at least until the fourth quarter, citing unnamed sources.\nChevron and Hess have previously said an FTC review in the third quarter would allow them to resolve the arbitration dispute by year-end.\n\"The arbitration is moving forward and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2024,\" Hess said on June 19.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d) projects WTI oil to average $82.03 per barrel in 2024, a notable increase from last year's $77.58. EIA noted that ongoing reductions in global oil stockpiles are expected to continue pushing commodity prices upward.\nWhile crude prices stay favorable, the likelihood of the commodity reaching $100 per barrel, as seen in 2022, is extremely slim. Additionally, EIA expects the annual GDP growth rate to decline to 2.4% in 2024 from last year's 2.5%. For 2025, the growth rate is projected to fall further to 1.8%. Thus, the forecasted slowdown of the GDP growth rate may consequently dampen energy demand, thereby negatively impacting commodity prices.\n3 Stocks to Gain\nThe current scenario highlights the need to keep a close watch on major energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX, and ConocoPhillips COP, which are known for their strong balance sheet. This is because these energy giants can rely on their financial stability to navigate a volatile and uncertain business environment. While Chevron has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nChevron and ExxonMobil boast robust balance sheet, enabling them to withstand challenging business environments. XOM\u2019s total debt-to-capitalization ratio stands at almost 16%, while Chevron's is at 11.9%, both significantly lower than the 24.2% average for composite stocks in the Zacks Oil & Gas Integrated International industry. Over the past three years, these industry leaders have consistently maintained lower debt-to-capitalization ratios, supported by strong oil prices that enhance their financial positions. This financial strength positions them well for future gains.\nConocoPhillips has secured a promising production outlook by capitalizing on its extensive drilling inventory and diverse upstream assets. Compared to composite stocks belonging to the industry, the leading upstream energy company has significantly less reliance on debt capital. This robust balance sheet positions ConocoPhillips to better withstand adverse business conditions. Like Chevron and ExxonMobil, favorable oil prices are also boosting COP\u2019s financial performance.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Developments associated with Kosmos Energy KOS, Eni SpA E and Pembina Pipeline Corporation PBA also grabbed attention.\n\nOverall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose around 2% to close at $83.16 per barrel, but natural gas prices fell 10.8% to end at $2.32 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).\n\nOil prices extended gains for the fourth straight week after a report from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showed drawdowns in crude and fuel stockpiles.\n\nMeanwhile, natural gas settled with a heavy loss following bearish inventory numbers, together with signs of production gains.\nRecap of the Week\u2019s Most Important Stories\n1.    American energy major ExxonMobil recently disclosed in a Form 8-K that soft natural gas prices due to lower demand and excess inventories will sequentially hurt its second-quarter 2024 earnings.\n\nOwing to changes in prices of the commodity, the leading integrated energy player expects its second-quarter earnings to decline sequentially by $300 million to $700 million. However, XOM projects that a favorable crude pricing scenario in the June quarter will completely offset this negative impact.\n\nExxonMobil added that unfavorable changes in industry margins will affect its earnings from refining activities by $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. These estimates exclude the impact of the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which was closed on May 3 and strengthened the company\u2019s footprint in the Permian Basin, the most prolific basin in the United States. (ExxonMobil Expects Soft Gas Prices to Hurt Q2 Earnings)\n\n2.    Shell expects a $2 billion impairment in the second quarter of 2024 after pausing its Rotterdam biofuels facility and divesting its Singapore refinery. Rotterdam's construction halt leads to a $600 million to $1 billion non-cash charge, while Singapore sees $600 million to $800 million in charges.\n\nAccording to the London-based energy biggie\u2019s latest update, Shell\u2019s upstream production fell 5.4% on a sequential basis in the second quarter of 2024 at the midpoint of the guidance. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) supermajor is estimating its output in the range of 1,720-1,820 (thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day) MBOE/d compared to 1,872 MBOE/d in the first quarter of 2024. Tax charges are expected to hurt earnings in the range of $1.8-$2.6 billion.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMeanwhile, Shell\u2019s LNG liquefaction volumes in its Integrated Gas unit are expected in the range of 6.8-7.2 million tons, translating into a decrease of around 7.7% sequentially. Shell\u2019s integrated gas production is expected in the range of 940,000-9800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) or 960,000 BOE/d at the midpoint. It was 992,000 BOE/d in the January-March period. (Shell Provides Q2 Guidance: Warns of Up to $2B Hit)\n\n3.    Kosmos Energy, a deepwater exploration and production firm, has announced the initiation of oil production from the Winterfell development in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Winterfell development in the Green Canyon area of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is operated by Beacon Offshore Energy, with Kosmos holding a 25.04% working interest in the field.\n\nWinterfell is a phased development. For the first phase, two production wells are currently online and working to increase the production from the development. Alongside, a third well is being drilled, expected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of 2024. The three wells are anticipated to produce 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).\n\nThe first phase includes five wells in total, which are projected to produce 100 million boe, with significant upside potential in subsequent phases. The Miocene-aged Winterfell field is situated in water depths of approximately 5,400 feet. It was developed using a 13-mile subsea tieback to a host platform operated by Occidental Petroleum. Discovered in 2021, the final investment decision for Winterfell was made in January 2024. (Kosmos Energy Hits Production Milestone With Winterfell)\n\n4.    Eni, an Italian energy giant, has announced a major new oil discovery in the Yopaat-1 EXP exploration well in Block 9, located approximately 63 kilometers off the coast in the mid-deep waters of the Cuenca Salina in the Sureste Basin, offshore Mexico. The preliminary estimates suggest that the discovery holds around 300-400 million barrels of oil equivalents (Mboe) and associated gas in place.\n\nThe Yopaat-1 EXP well was drilled in a water depth of 525 meters and reached a total depth of 2,931 meters, encountering approximately 200 meters of net pay of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in the Pliocene and Miocene sequences. The drilling operation was accompanied by an extensive subsurface data acquisition campaign, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the geological formation.\n\nEni's presence in Mexico dates back to 2006. In 2015, the company established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eni Mexico S. de R. L. de C.V. Today, Eni stands as the leading foreign operator in the country, holding rights in eight exploration and production blocks in the Sureste Basin, of which the company operates seven.

Pembina Pipeline, an energy transportation and midstream services provider, has entered into a purchase and sale agreement through its joint venture entity, Pembina Gas Infrastructure Inc. (\"PGI\"), with Whitecap Resources Inc., a Calgary-based oil and gas exploration and production company.\n\nThis strategic collaboration will see PGI acquiring a 50% working interest in Whitecap\u2019s 15-07 Kaybob Complex in Alberta and supporting the infrastructure development of the company\u2019s Lator growth area. The gross proceeds related to this transaction amount to C$420 million, with C$252 million net to Pembina.\n\nDespite the acquisition, Whitecap will retain operatorship of the assets.

One of the latest such developments was the strong Q2 delivery data provided by Hydrogen-powered truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). In Q2, the company delivered 72 such trucks, well above its previous guidance of 60. Moreover, one of its customers was Walmart\u2019s (NYSE:WMT) Canada unit. That indicates that the world\u2019s largest retailer is interested in participating in the Hydrogen Revolution.\nMeanwhile, in Australia, Climate Impact Corporation intends to develop a huge 20 gigawatts of green hydrogen initiatives. The firm plans to partner with GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) for the projects. Here are three top hydrogen fuel stocks that can soar as the demand for green hydrogen surges.\nPlug Power (PLUG)\nPerson holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to lay the groundwork to become a leader of the Hydrogen Revolution. The company is reporting huge losses. However, in the coming years, it plans to build several new green hydrogen plants. Given the large, growing demand for green hydrogen, and the tax credits for the fuel in the U.S., the company\u2019s fuel business will likely become very profitable in the long-term. Indeed, Plug has said that it plans to generate \u201cgrowing positive fuel margins in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSimilarly, deployments of the company\u2019s electrolyzers are rapidly ramping up. As a result, I believe that this business will generate huge profits over the long-term as its revenue surges and its costs drop. Electrolyzers are used to produce green hydrogen.\nShowing how rapidly the business is growing, Plug reported that it plans to \u201cship and begin commissioning\u201d at least 37 electrolyzers in 2024. These units will produce 40 metric tons of green hydrogen per day.\nMoreover, Plug is likely to benefit from Nikola\u2019s success, since the two firms announced a partnership in December 2022. With Plug becoming a leader in the green hydrogen boom, I believe that it is one of the best hydrogen fuel stocks to buy.\nAir Products (APD)\nAir Products truck on motorway. APD stock.\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock\nAir Products (NYSE:APD) provides gases for industrial companies, and looks poised to benefit tremendously from strong demand for green hydrogen. Last month, Air Products disclosed that it had signed a 15-year deal to provide 70,000 tons of green hydrogen to TotalEnergies in Europe. The deliveries are slated to begin in 2030.\nAlso last month, the firm announced that it would \u201cbuild a network of hydrogen refueling stations running the length of California.\u201d As a result, the company looks poised to become a leader in the operation of such stations. Given the likely strong demand for hydrogen in the U.S., these stations are likely to eventually become very profitable.\nThe company plans to build a $4 billion green hydrogen plant in Texas. However, APD has decided to wait for the IRS to issue the final rules on America\u2019s hydrogen tax credits before making its final investment decision. But, since the company said that the initial rules reduced by the agency were acceptable, it is likely to proceed. The facility will give the company another way to benefit from the strong demand for green hydrogen.\nGiven the many ways in which Air Products looks poised to benefit from the Hydrogen Revolution, I view it as one of the top hydrogen fuel stocks.\nAir Liquide (AIQUY)\nAir Liquide (AIQUY) company logo on a gas tank. Air Liquide S.A. is a French multinational company which supplies industrial gases and services\nSource: Oliver Hoffmann / Shutterstock.com\nGas producer Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) is slated to become a major supplier for Exxon Mobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM). XOM plans to build a hydrogen plant in Texas which will also produce ammonia. Air Liquide intends to supply 9,000 metric tons per day of oxygen and up to 6,500 metric tons per day of nitrogen to the facility. According to Exxon, the plant will become the world\u2019s largest producer of hydrogen. It is slated to produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of hydrogen.\nInterestingly, Air Liquide also looks poised to benefit from the AI Revolution. That\u2019s because it\u2019s building a $250 million plant in Idaho to provide Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and other chip makers with gases. The facility is supposed to start producing gas at the end of next year.\nKeep an eye on AIQUY since it is dipping its toes into two different, yet lucrative, markets.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in PLUG,GEV, and MU.

Of course, those same investors would gladly reap short-term gains if they were reliable, but they aren\u2019t. It remains incredibly difficult to identify stocks that will perform well over the short term. Yet, identifying stocks with the potential to create long-term wealth has proven easier.\nGiven time, companies with readily identifiable fundamental strengths tend to increase in value. These are the kinds of stocks you\u2019re likely to find recommended by value investors such as Warren Buffett.\nInvesting in strong companies with durable competitive advantages is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. These are the kind of companies that routinely maintain strong pricing advantages over the long term that create all kinds of beneficial internal economics. The companies discussed below certainly benefit from those factors and more, which is the reason to buy now.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nmicrosoft stock\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\nOne of the best reasons to believe Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock will continue to create long-term wealth for investors is its forecast growth.\nMicrosoft reported just under $212 billion in sales in 2023. That figure is expected to approximately double by 2028. Given how successful the company has been in investing in artificial intelligence, it\u2019s easy to see why Microsoft continues to be so loved.\nIt is one of the so-called hyperscaler companies looking to commoditize artificial intelligence. It is doing so by buying up massive quantities of AI chips and implementing them at its data centers.\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more a part of our lives Microsoft should become that much more valuable.\nThe strategy is highly logical and is part of a broader thinking that characterizes AI as the new digital gold. Outside of AI, Microsoft continues to be subsidized by the strength of its Office and Windows products. Microsoft has multiple ways to continue winning and creating long-term wealth.\nAmazon (AMZN)\nAn image of an Amazon logo on a building\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another strong choice for investors looking for stocks that will create long-term wealth. I believe many investors automatically discount Amazon and other similarly sized companies for the simple fact that they believe past growth is not replicable.\nAfter all, Amazon reported $574 billion in revenues in 2023. It\u2019s therefore easy to presume growth will slow due to reaching such a massive scale. Yet, it\u2019s possible that Amazon could reach $1 trillion in sales by 2028. It is predicted to come very close as it will grow by roughly 70% over that period.\nWhat I particularly like about Amazon is the company\u2019s substantial investment in Anthropic, for which it recently completed its $4 billion investment. I believe Amazon will benefit substantially from that investment as Anthropic is noted to take a slower, more pragmatic approach to AI development than rival OpenAI. That developmental approach is likely to yield better results in the enterprise space, which requires greater accuracy and where substantial revenues will flow from.\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\nExxon Retail Gas Location\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has long proven capable of creating long-term wealth. It is primarily an income-producing stock with much of its long-term wealth-creating ability coming from dividends. However, it also produces substantial share price gains as oil prices peak.\nWe now may be entering another such period as Brent crude surges past $86 per barrel. Analysts believe that it could peak above $90. Standard Chartered says the current supply deficit characterizing the third quarter will spill into the fourth quarter. That suggests Exxon Mobil will perform strongly throughout the remainder of 2024.\nAnd while investors should be able to capitalize on those supply shortfalls, there are other reasons to like ExxonMobil. Most investors will compare it to Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the other common Big Oil choice. But with a choice between the two, Exxon is better at creating more value than Chevron. The peak oil argument was overdone and companies like ExxonMobil continue to have the ability to create long-term wealth for investors.\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Additionally, its announcement regarding diminished refining margins exacerbates apprehensions about second-quarter earnings performance.\nThe critical question now facing investors is how to strategically position themselves regarding the stock. Before addressing this, let's review some fundamental aspects of ExxonMobil.\nStrong Permian & Guyana Presence\nWith a strong focus on strengthening its presence in the Permian, ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company on May 3. With 1.4 million net acres of the combined company in the Delaware and Midland basins, having an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource, ExxonMobil has greatly transformed its upstream portfolio.\nThe company expects that based on 2023 volumes, its production from the most prolific basin will more than double to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D). For 2027, the energy giant expects its Permian production volume to increase to 2 MMBoE/D.\nSimilar to its operations in the Permian, ExxonMobil boasts a robust project pipeline in offshore Guyana resources. The company is well-positioned to generate significant returns from both the Permian and Guyana due to low production costs in these assets. With oil prices remaining favorable this year, ExxonMobil is strategically poised to generate substantial cash flows from its upstream operations, which contribute the majority to its total earnings.\nIntegrated Business Model & Robust Balance Sheet\nDue to its integrated business model, ExxonMobil is well protected when oil price turns low. This is because, apart from exploration and production activities, the company has an extensive footprint in refining and chemical businesses.\nDuring uncertain times, ExxonMobil can rely on its robust balance sheet. Compared to the industry composite stocks, which have a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 24.2%, ExxonMobil maintains a much lower ratio at 15.9%. Favorable commodity prices have enabled it to enhance its financial position and repay the debt incurred during the pandemic. Chevron Corporation CVX is another integrated energy giant with a strong balance sheet. Belonging to the same industry, Chevron has a much lower debt-to-capitalization ratio of 11.9%.\nBP plc BP, another major player in the integrated energy space, is also reducing its debt load backed by higher oil prices and decreased capital spending. BP\u2019s debt-to-capitalization ratio is much higher at 38.4%.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEntry Into the Lithium Market\nIn addition to its traditional upstream and downstream energy operations, ExxonMobil is entering the lithium market, a critical component in electric vehicle batteries. The world is demanding more lithium to meet the growth in electric vehicles, and XOM is thus well-positioned to gain in the long run.\nOn Jun 25, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with SK On to supply up to 100,000 metric tons of lithium from its upcoming project in Arkansas. SK On will utilize this lithium in its U.S.-based electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility.\nKeep an Eye on the Stock\nExxonMobil, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), maintains a robust and diversified business model, which will enable it to continue returning cash to shareholders. Over the past 41 years, XOM's dividend payments have grown at an average annual rate of 5.8%.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThese positive developments are evident in the year-to-date price performance of XOM's stock. During this period, the company has appreciated 12.9%, outperforming the 7.7% increase of the industry.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt is evident that while ExxonMobil expects challenges such as soft gas prices and unfavorable industry margins to affect second-quarter earnings, the company's long-term outlook remains promising. However, investors are advised against rushing to add the stock to their portfolios at present and should instead await a more opportune entry point.\nThis is because, at this moment, shares are somewhat expensive on a relative basis, with the current 6.15X trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization staying above the 6.12X five-year median. Also, the company is trading at a premium to the broader industry average of 3.95X.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ten projects. Twelve years. One prolific offshore block.\nAnd a combined capex that could reach as high as $105 billion.\nThe consortium of Exxon Mobil, Hess Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) has already made final investment decisions (FID) worth $54.5 billion on six projects in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. Moving forward is simply a matter of figuring out the best way to exploit a resource estimated at 11 Bboe.\nAlistair Routledge, the president of Exxon Mobil Guyana, said the resource figure was based on a lot of analyses but also a lot of uncertainty. Each partner is working with its own numbers, he said during a panel discussion at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in May.\n\u201cThe six initial [projects] are developing around 4.9 billion oil equivalent barrels. So, we are already getting close to developing half of that resource through the commitments that we\u2019ve made to date. That still leaves another 6 billion,\u201d Routledge said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically working through that resource base to understand it, [and] one of the particular areas of focus \u2026 is the gas resource.\u201d\nHe reiterated that the figures were resources, not reserves. Future updates to the resource estimate could take time owing to the huge amount of data to sort through and understand.\n\u201cOur focus has actually shifted to: are we moving the resource into project execution? We are focused on getting those matured,\u201d Routledge said. \u201cWe are very encouraged with the work that has been going on with all the technical teams around concepts and maturing the understanding of that resource, both from a reservoir static and dynamic performance perspective.\u201d\nCombined production from the first phase of development will reach 1.33 MMbbl/d by 2027, according to Exxon.\n\u201cIn general, if you look at the entirety of Exxon\u2019s portfolio, this is the place that they want to spend money,\u201d Rystad Energy Senior Vice President and Head of Latin America W. Schreiner Parker told Oil and Gas Investor (OGI).\nA second phase of development will require four new FPSOs in Stabroek over the near term. The last project sanctioned by the consortium, Whiptail in April 2024, cost $12.7 billion with associated FPSO production capacity of 250,000 bbl/d. Assuming future projects will be of the same magnitude, the combined FIDs will total about $51 billion and add at least 1 MMbbl/d of production.\nParker expects the consortium to spend an average of about $10 billion per year between 2025 and 2030, mostly on development but also on exploration.\nThe expense will not divert Exxon from its \u201cbuild one, design many\u201d mindset in Guyana. Parker expects the consortium to move forward with construction of the FPSOs. Welligence Energy Analytics Vice President Andre Fagundes agrees.\n\u201cOur valuation model considers the installation of five additional FPSOs at Stabroek by 2029 with a total capex of $52 billion, and followed by two additional [FPSOs] in 2030 and 2031,\u201d Fagundes told OGI. He doubts the consortium will be constrained by finances.\n(Source: Exxon Mobil Corp./ Hess Corp.)\n(Source: Welligence Energy Analytics/ Hart Energy)\n\u201cGiven the exceptional fiscal terms and projected production growth, we estimate the projects to be practically self-funded from their own free cash flow,\u201d Fagundes said. \u201cConsequently, we believe that the project partners are financially equipped to support this development.\u201d\nStabroek is located approximately 120 miles offshore Guyana and covers 6.6 million acres. The block is equivalent in size to 1,150 U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) blocks and contains multiple prospects and play types, according to Hess.\nExxon Mobil Guyana operates Stabroek and holds a 45% interest. Its local partners include Hess Guyana Exploration (30%) and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana (25%).\nQuick rise\nGuyana was colonized by the Dutch in the 17th century, but by 1815 had become a British possession. It is the third-smallest country in South America after Suriname to its east and Uruguay to the south. It is almost twice the size of Tennessee with a population of about 800,000.\nExxon initiated exploration offshore Guyana in 2008 and drilled its first exploration well, Liza-1, in 2015. That well encountered over 295 ft of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and was safely drilled to 17,825 ft in 5,719 ft of water.\n\u201cGuyana is a long-time gold producer and also had a history where there was this big belief that there was going to be the \u2018El Dorado,\u2019 the big find of oil in Guyana,\u201d Exxon\u2019s Routledge said during OTC.\n\u201cWell, finally we have it and it\u2019s catapulting Guyana up the league tables and becoming a true emerging powerhouse of energy in South America, and a vital source of energy \u2026 in a world that needs that diversity of supply to give us all security and affordability of energy supply,\u201d he said.\nTo grasp the impact of the \u201cbig find,\u201d consider that oil production is responsible for Guyana\u2019s GDP soaring to $14.7 billion in 2022 from $1.1 billion in 2005, according to the World Bank.\nExxon\u2019s first three Stabroek projects\u2014Liza 1 (using the Liza Destiny FPSO), Liza 2 (Liza Unity FPSO) and Payara (Prosperity FPSO)\u2014produce just north of 600,000 bbl/d, analysts estimate.\n(Source: Exxon Mobil)\n\u201cIn terms of the production, we\u2019re kind of in a little bit of a plateau here in 2024 to 2025, but it will essentially double between next year and 2030 off the back of all that investment that\u2019s going to take place between 2025 and 2030,\u201d Rystad\u2019s Parker told OGI.\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth Stabroek projects have been sanctioned but have yet to start producing. All will use FPSOs with production capacity of 250,000 bbl/d.\nYellowtail, sanctioned in April 2022, will use the ONE GUYANA FPSO with first oil expected in 2025; Uaru, sanctioned in April 2023, will use the Errea Wittu FPSO, with first oil expected in 2026. Whiptail, sanctioned in April 2024, will use the Jaguar FPSO, with first oil expected in 2027.\nThe Liza Unity FPSO will operate in Liza Phase 2. (Source: Lim Weixiang)\nFollow the money\nExxon\u2019s Routledge said about one-third of the capital spend in Guyana was on the wells that are drilled, another third on subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF), and the remainder on the FPSOs.\n\u201cWe tend to focus on the FPSOs because that\u2019s what we see every day, and when we go offshore, we get to land on those, and that\u2019s where our workforce is. But the reality is, most of the work goes into what sits on the seabed or indeed the wells that go down into the reservoirs,\u201d Routledge said.\nStena Drilling and Noble Corp. are Exxon\u2019s main drilling contractors. They have provided the Stabroek consortium with six deepwater rigs, which are operating at a \u201cbenchmarking and industry-leading pace,\u201d Routledge said.\n\u201cThey set an aspirational goal just a year and a half ago that they would achieve zero/five/35 in the drilling operations. And that was zero safety incidents, less than 5% non-productive time and 35 days to drill and complete these deepwater wells. They have already achieved wells in less than 30 days, drilled and completed, which in all the benchmarking you look at just sets a new level of performance,\u201d Routledge said.\nEach of the FPSOs in Stabroek can store up to 2 MMbbl of oil. Exxon\u2019s cargo lifts can total 1 MMbbl, so the FPSOs need to unload a cargo every four days.\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019re using the very large crude carrier (VLCC), which are 2 MMbbl vessels. They will take two separate cargoes, so we will attach them to one of the FPSOs, lift a 1 MMbbl cargo, and then they\u2019ll disconnect and either go to one of the other terminals or reconnect afterwards. These are vast vessels, and once connected are less than 492 feet apart in the ocean,\u201d Routledge said, adding it takes around 24 hours to pump 1 MMbbl from the FPSO onto the carriers.\n\u2018Tiger economy\u2019\n\u201cGuyana is a tiger economy moving at a rapid pace and this is probably the last time you will see such a development in the world,\u201d Guyana Office for Investment Agency Head Peter R. Ramsaroop told OGI on the sidelines of OTC. \u201cSo, if you are in the oil business and you\u2019re not in Guyana, you\u2019re missing out.\u201d\nRamsaroop said that the next wave of Guyana\u2019s economic growth would focus on agriculture sustainability, food security, climate security and energy security. Ramsaroop said Guyana would \u201clead CARICOM (Caribbean Community) in those areas.\u201d\nRamsaroop said the government of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali plans to continue to grow the country while ensuring that the people benefit. He warned that Guyana needed a lot more skilled people.\n\u201cLike Dubai or Qatar, we are out of resources. If you win a contract to build a 20-mile road or a bridge, you have to bring your people,\u201d Ramsaroop said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on new immigration policies and making it easier for work permits over time. But by 2030 plus, we may have around 3 million people in Guyana.\u201d\nThe country occupies 83,000 square miles, or about the size of Great Britain, he said. But Great Britain\u2019s population is about 65 million. \u201cFor us to develop Guyana to the level that Guyana is being developed, you need people.\u201d Ramsaroop reiterated.\n\u201cWe have a low-carbon development strategy. We have the lowest deforestation rate. We\u2019re doing things in a sustainable manner, but don\u2019t tell us to keep our people poor,\u201d Ramsaroop said. \u201cIf the other option is to cut our $95 billion forest down, we won\u2019t do that [either].\u201d\nGuyana\u2019s impressive growth story has attracted the attention of government and companies alike. Chevron\u2019s $53 billion all-stock offer for Hess is as much about Guyana as much as it is about Chevron adding assets in the GoM, offshore Southeast Asia and in the Bakken Shale.\nHess\u2019 assets in Stabroek instigated a spat between Chevron and Exxon, drawing in CNOOC as the latter two claim they have a right of first refusal (ROFR) to Hess\u2019 interest. Arbitration among the three companies continues.\nChevron\u2019s deal with Hess could close in 2025, TD Cowen managing director David Deckelbaum wrote in an April commentary.\nRoutledge told OGI that \u201cOur balance sheet is in good shape [and] what we are looking for are just good investments.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not in position to make any decision on other equity in Stabroek Block right now, but we are focused on [finding] the right opportunities\u2014whether in Guyana or elsewhere in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they compete [financially], then we have the resources to get after them.\u201d", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Offshore-Guyana-Place-Spend-Money-170000706.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.0351279303, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}, {"Ticker": "XOM", "Time": "2024-07-09T13:01:00.000Z", "Headline": "BP Stock Slips.

However, XOM projects that a favorable crude pricing scenario in the June quarter will completely offset this negative impact.\nExxonMobil added that unfavorable changes in industry margins will affect its earnings from refining activities by $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. These estimates exclude the impact of the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which was closed on May 3 and strengthened the company\u2019s footprint in the Permian Basin, the most prolific basin in the United States.\nThe additional impact from the Pioneer Natural acquisition is expected to result in the production of 500-550 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Consequently, the company estimates that its production will exceed 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, positioning it for significant growth and enhanced operational scale.\nChevron generates most of its earnings from its upstream operations. The integrated energy giant has a strong foothold in the Permian \u2013 the most prolific basin in the United States \u2013 where a significant portion of the energy major\u2019s acreage has minimum royalty payments. Thus, CVX will generate handsome cashflows through its upstream business, banking on handsome oil prices.\nIn addition to maintaining disciplined capital spending, Chevron has a strong balance sheet, providing a solid foundation to rely on during unfavorable energy market conditions.\nTo expand its premier asset portfolio, SM Energy recently agreed to acquire 80% of XCL Resources\u2019 oil and gas assets in the Uinta Basin for $2.04 billion. The value-driven acquisition, likely to close in September this year, will increase its inventory of net locations and boost its oil production.

Although the company has lagged the stock market and even produced a lost decade for investors, the stock is rebounding. New investments into cloud computing have positioned IBM to capitalize on artificial intelligence tailwinds. The stock has a spark based on its 9% year-to-date gain and 33% gain over the past year.\nInvestors don\u2019t need IBM to do as well on stock price returns to stay ahead of the market. The yield is quite high, and IBM continues to hike its dividend each year. The company raised its quarterly dividend from $1.66 per share to $1.67 per share this year.\nThe low dividend growth rate is based on IBM\u2019s low growth rates. The company only reported 1% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, although the growth rate goes up to 3% at constant currency. However, the company grew its net income by 73% year-over-year and ended up with a double-digit net profit margin.\nSysco (SYY)\nBest Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)\nSource: Shutterstock\nMost high-yielding stocks trade long-term gains for high yields and stability.

Shares only dropped by about 3% in 2022. That year featured many meltdowns from tech stocks and pandemic favorites, but Sysco held steady.\nSysco tends to report low-single-digit revenue growth, and the company did not disappoint.

Exxon Mobil hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.91 per share to $0.95 per share last year.

Presently, we have thousands upon thousands of publicly traded opportunities available. It\u2019s simply not possible for analysts to provide equal coverage to every enterprise. So, it\u2019s inevitable that some companies \u2013 even big ones \u2013 fall through the cracks. Intrepid investors can exploit this \u201ccoverage gap\u201d so to speak and potentially profit handsomely.\nFurther, in shaky circumstances \u2013 such as a recovery from a pandemic \u2013 the established players can deliver some surprises. Basically, their massive footprint enables surprisingly stout performances. With that in mind, below are enticing high-yield safe stocks to consider.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nPepsiCo (PEP)\nPepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest beverage (and snack) manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is no stranger to the business community. Thanks to its massive footprint, it easily commands stability. Further, amid a tough economic environment, PepsiCo offers a cheap source of caffeine. Given this and many other advantages, it\u2019s no surprise that analysts rate PEP stock a consensus moderate buy.\nAnother factor to consider regarding Pepsi is its financial consistency. During the past four quarters, its average earnings per share landed at $1.90. However, covering experts anticipated EPS of almost $1.81. Therefore, the earnings surprise came out to nearly 5.1%. That\u2019s not bad for an established stalwart.\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Pepsi posted net income of $9.18 billion or earnings of $6.63 per share. Revenue during the cycle came out to $91.88 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate 11.2% growth in the top line to $94.44 billion.\nLastly, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 3.33%. It makes a solid case for high-yield safe stocks to buy.\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\nExxon Retail Gas Location\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nOn the surface, integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem the most relevant idea for high-yield safe stocks. With the ideological winds pushing for green and sustainable solutions, Exxon seems anachronistic. Still, the world runs on oil. And one geopolitical flashpoint could change the narrative cynically in favor of XOM stock. Thus, it carries a moderate buy view among experts with a $135.53 average price target.\nAdmittedly, Exxon has encountered a rough patch in terms of meeting expectations. In the past four quarters, its average EPS reached just under $2.19. However, analysts were looking on average for around $2.20. Therefore, the earnings surprise landed at about half a percent below parity. That\u2019s not ideal.\nDuring the TTM period, Exxon posted net income of $32.8 billion or $8.16 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $335.35 billion, which is rather disappointing. For fiscal 2024, analysts only see a modest lift in the top line to $353.7 billion. However, it\u2019s also possible that sales could soar to $470.13 billion based on geopolitical rumblings.\nOh yeah, the oil giant offers a big yield of 3.31%.\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\nMcDonald's golden arches\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. Basically, the Golden Arches is both a business icon and a symbol of American capitalism. So, when it comes to attributes like brand power and awareness, MCD hits the safe component of high-yield safe stocks. However, does it provide much growth and is it a dividend monster?\nTo be sure, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to expect a blue-chip icon to have the growth potential of a promising tech startup. However, McDonald\u2019s is a respectable growth machine given how long it\u2019s been in business. During the TTM period, it posted net income of $8.6 billion on sales of $25.76 billion. In the most recent quarter, its sales growth rate (year-over-year) came in at 4.6%.\nSure, that\u2019s not the most impressive stat you\u2019ve seen. However, keep in mind that for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate revenue of $26.6 billion. That\u2019s up 11.7% from the prior year. As for the bottom line, McDonald\u2019s has seen average EPS of $2.96 in the past four quarters. That helps to support the underlying dividend yield of 2.67%. Overall, it\u2019s one of the balanced high-yield safe stocks to buy.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
