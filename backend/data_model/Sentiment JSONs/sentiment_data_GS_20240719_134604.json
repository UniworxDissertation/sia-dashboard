(GS) Right Now?", "Summary": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against the other financial stocks.\nThe financial services industry in the US is poised for a dynamic and challenging year ahead, shaped by a confluence of economic, technological, and regulatory factors. The global economy is anticipated to grow modestly, with advanced economies like the US expecting around 1.4% growth. This is influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate-related disruptions, and persistently high inflation rates. These macroeconomic conditions are expected to significantly impact the operations and profitability of financial institutions. High interest rates have been a double-edged sword for the industry. While they have led to substantial increases in net interest income, particularly for larger banks, they have also driven up funding costs, especially for smaller and regional banks, squeezing their margins. According to Deloitte, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy will be crucial, with expectations that rates will remain elevated initially but may decrease later in the year. This will necessitate careful management of the balance between deposit rates and lending rates to sustain profitability. Economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth have prompted banks to increase their loan loss provisions as a precautionary measure to cover potential defaults. This trend is expected to persist, reflecting a cautious approach to managing credit risk amidst economic volatility and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nConcurrently, the financial services sector is experiencing significant technological shifts. Advances in AI and generative AI are set to transform various aspects of the industry, from retail investing and fraud detection to insurance offerings. However, these advancements also introduce new risks, such as heightened fraud potential and the need for robust cybersecurity measures. On the regulatory front, changes are becoming more stringent, particularly around climate-related disclosures and sustainability. Financial institutions are required to adapt to these new regulations aimed at enhancing transparency and effectively managing climate risks. These regulatory changes, coupled with technological advancements, are forcing financial institutions to innovate and evolve their business models and strategies. Overall, banks and financial institutions must remain agile and proactive, navigating these multifaceted challenges to maintain profitability and drive growth in 2024. This will involve balancing the benefits and risks of high interest rates, managing loan loss provisions prudently, leveraging technological advancements, and complying with evolving regulatory requirements.\nIn a recent development, major U.S. banks withstood a hypothetical 40% decline in commercial real estate values in the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual health test, which alleviated concerns about the banking sector amid rising interest rates. With increasing risks in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, investors were keenly observing the Fed's stress tests to gauge the exposure of American lenders at a time when pandemic-era work patterns have left office towers largely vacant, pushing vacancy rates to a historic high of 20%. Chris Marinac, head of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, commented, \u201cIn many ways, there should be a sense of relief that banks can endure a severe crisis. However, this doesn\u2019t mean the Fed believes commercial real estate is in the clear. We are still in the early stages of this credit cycle\u201d. The Fed's stress tests evaluate banks' balance sheets against a hypothetical severe economic downturn, including a 36% drop in U.S. home prices, a 55% plunge in equity prices, and an unemployment rate of 10%, reported Reuters.\nResults of the stress test released recently showed that banks could continue lending to households and businesses in the event of a severe global recession and indicated the capital needed to be deemed healthy and to determine how much they can return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. The 31 large banks tested demonstrated they had enough capital to absorb nearly $685 billion in losses. This test comes over a year after the collapse of mid-sized lenders like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic, which sparked criticism that the Fed had underestimated banks' vulnerabilities to rising interest rates, previously assuming rates would fall during a severe recession. Commercial office space is a significant concern, with $929 billion of the $4.7 trillion in outstanding commercial mortgages maturing in 2024, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This approaching maturity wall occurs amid declining property values and reduced rental income. Analysts foresee a challenging period for CRE, with banks still having \"considerable concentration risks,\" according to Moody's Ratings. Of the banks tested, Goldman Sachs had the highest projected loan loss for commercial real estate at 15.9%, followed by RBC USA (15.8%), Capital One (14.6%), and Northern Trust (13%). One critique from analysts is that the Fed's stress test did not include regional banks, which hold most of the CRE loans and are less regulated than their larger counterparts.\nOver the coming months, senior leaders in the financial services industry anticipate a challenging landscape marked by high interest rates, increased regulatory scrutiny, and persistent inflation concerns. While these trends are familiar to industry veterans, many younger employees have not encountered such conditions before. According to Deloitte, leaders will need to guide their teams through uncertainty, focusing on navigating near-term challenges and identifying potential opportunities. Looking ahead, rapid technological advancements\u2014including generative AI, cloud migration, heightened fraud and cyber risks, and the convergence of industries through embedded finance\u2014will demand unprecedented agility from financial services leaders. Adapting to these changes will require creating new strategic pathways to align with evolving market dynamics. Throughout history, the financial services sector has often driven progress by helping organizations and individuals navigate economic and societal shifts. By the end of this decade, 2024 may be recognized as a pivotal year when the future began to materialize in tangible ways. Investing now in innovative products and services that foster positive outcomes could position firms for sustained competitive advantage in the years ahead.\nOur Methodology\nWe leveraged Insider Monkey\u2019s comprehensive database of 920 prominent hedge funds to identify the top 10 financial stocks with the highest level of hedge fund investment as of Q1 2024.

The top-line came in strong led by elevated financing activity and an improvement in advisory revenues, despite weak transaction volumes within the investment banking segment. Should conditions remain conducive, management remains cautiously optimistic the business will experience continued recovery in both capital markets and strategy activity. Meanwhile, GS continues to successfully execute on its strategic initiatives to improve the overall return of the company.

This industry-first portfolio leverages Goldman Sachs' expertise in bond markets and Betterment's automation. The portfolio seeks to generate after-tax yield.\nBetterment\nThe Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds portfolio is designed for Betterment clients in higher tax brackets, who want to access a tax-smart bond strategy which is potentially lower risk than equity investing. While high-interest cash savings products can be beneficial for shorter-term needs, taxes can reduce yields over time. This new portfolio offers short-duration bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with holdings that Betterment will personalize for its customers based on their tax situation.\nBy combining short-duration US Treasury bonds, high-quality corporate bonds and municipal bond ETFs, Goldman Sachs designed this innovative strategy to marry longer-term trends with current bond market conditions, rather than maintaining static allocations over time. This approach can adjust the strategy for events that might create volatility such as the COVID-19 pandemic and US debt ceiling debates. The portfolio strategy considers market conditions and taxable equivalent yields monthly, and Betterment may make adjustments, based on individual tax brackets, as appropriate. Betterment then personalizes portfolio allocations for its clients' individual tax situations to seek to generate higher after-tax yield.\n\"We are thrilled to collaborate with Goldman Sachs to bring an innovative bond portfolio to Betterment customers,\" said Sarah Levy, CEO of Betterment. \"We continue to work tirelessly to provide investment products that support our customers in their long-term wealth-building journey.\"\n\"It is important for investors seeking to create and safeguard long-term wealth to consider after-tax returns in their portfolios,\" said Padideh Raphael, Global Head of Third Party Wealth at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"This latest collaboration, combining Goldman Sachs's investment capabilities with Betterment's innovative technology platform and customer-first approach, will allow us to work together on behalf of clients who seek attractive after-tax bond yields.\"\nFor more information about the Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds portfolio, please visit Betterment's website.\nAbout Betterment\nBetterment LLC (\"Betterment\") is the largest independent digital financial advisor, using automated technology powered by human expertise to fulfill a singular mission: making people's lives better.

(NYSE:GS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $3.00 on the 27th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 2.4% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\nGoldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings\nUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Goldman Sachs Group is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. With the company not bringing in any cash, paying out to shareholders is bound to become difficult at some point.\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 27.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\nhistoric-dividend\nGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track Record\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $12.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 20% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Goldman Sachs Group has been growing its earnings per share at 5.2% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Goldman Sachs Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\nOur Thoughts On Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend\nOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Goldman Sachs Group will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Goldman Sachs Group is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

It has amassed assets over $1.73 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\nWhy Large Cap Blend\nCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\nCosts\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.11%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.20%.\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 6.32% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 30.98% of total assets under management.\nPerformance and Risk\nGUSA seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE GBS US 1000 INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive GBS United States 1000 Index measures the performance of equity securities of large and mid-capitalization equity issuers covering approximately the largest 1,000 of the free-float market capitalization in the United States.\nThe ETF has gained about 17.14% so far this year and is up about 24.32% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $35.52 and $48.82.\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.83% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1013 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\nAlternatives\nGoldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GUSA is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $504.65 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $556.35 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\nBottom-Line\nWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:GS) Released Earnings Last Week And Analysts Lifted Their Price Target To US$493", "Summary": "A week ago, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) came out with a strong set of quarterly numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. The company beat expectations with revenues of US$13b arriving 2.9% ahead of forecasts. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) were US$8.62, 2.4% ahead of estimates. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\nearnings-and-revenue-growth\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Goldman Sachs Group's 19 analysts is for revenues of US$51.2b in 2024. This would reflect a modest 4.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 17% to US$36.32. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$50.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$36.48 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nWith the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 5.7% to US$493. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Goldman Sachs Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$571 and the most bearish at US$373 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Goldman Sachs Group shareholders.\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 9.4% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.2% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.6% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Goldman Sachs Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\nServices inflation, which policymakers have been watching for signs of continued domestic price pressures, held steady at 5.7% for the second straight month. That compares with the 5.6% rate expected by economists immediately before the data\u2019s release and the 5.1% level that the central bank\u2019s most recent forecasts had anticipated by now.\nThe increase was largely driven by hotel and restaurant prices as the effects of an almost 10% rise in the minimum wage and the arrival of Taylor Swift\u2019s The Eras Tour filtered through the economy. Persistence in services inflation will further complicate calculations before Governor Andrew Bailey announces the BOE\u2019s next decision on Aug. 1, even with headline inflation holding steady at the official 2% target.\n\u201cThe data today challenge the idea of a cut in August,\u201d said Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at T Rowe Price. \u201cInflation is not yet coming down in a sustainable fashion.\u201d\nTraders pushed back bets on a rate cut next month, pricing in a roughly 30% chance of an August move, down from almost 50% on Tuesday. The pound erased losses to trade 0.4% stronger at about $1.30 for the first time in a year, as traders priced in the prospect that the Federal Reserve may cut rates before the BOE.\nGilt yields rose across the curve, with the two-year rate rising as much as seven basis points to 4.06%, although that\u2019s still around the lowest level this year.\nWhile the UK\u2019s newly elected prime minister, Keir Starmer, will welcome a stronger pound, his government won\u2019t want to see Britain\u2019s mortgage holders wait much longer for a rate cut. Starmer and his chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, have blamed the Conservative government that left power on July 5 for weakening the currency and pushing up mortgage costs.\nThe figures come days after the economy recorded growth of 0.4% in May, double the pace that had been expected. It points to another solid quarter of expansion, continuing a recovery from last year\u2019s mild recession.\n\u201cToday\u2019s data should close the door on an August rate cut,\u201d said Zara Nokes, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cThis inflation print, coupled with ongoing resilience in economic activity is likely stronger than the data the bank is looking for to start cutting rates.\u201d\nPrices for restaurants and hotels rose by 6.3% in the year to June, up from 5.8% in May, according to Office for National Statistics data. The increase in the annual rate was almost entirely down to hotel room prices, which saw a monthly rise of 8.8%.\nA tight labor market and the minimum wage increase that took effect in April are forcing companies to pay more to attract staff. Tomorrow\u2019s jobs data will provide a further reading of underlying inflationary pressure in the labor market.\nBOE officials, notably Chief Economist Huw Pill, have expressed concern about lingering inflationary forces in the labor market and services sector.\nEconomists said there were also some signs that Swift\u2019s UK tour in June, which included events in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London, may have also provided a temporary boost to the services inflation figure. The ONS collected data for hotel prices between concerts in Edinburgh and Liverpool, while the figures showed Swift is likely to have also boosted live music ticket prices. The effect may continue in August, when Swift returns for more dates in London.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says ...\n\u201cThe stickiness of both headline and services inflation in June\u2019s CPI print has lowered the chances of the Bank of England easing at its August meeting. On balance we\u2019re sticking to our call that rates will fall next month \u2014 the central bank has shown some tolerance for upside data surprises.\u201d\n\u2014Dan Hanson and Ana Andrade, Bloomberg Economics. Click for the REACT.\n\u201cHotel prices rose strongly while second-hand car costs fell, but by less than this time last year,\u201d said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS. He added that these were offset by falling clothing prices after \u201cwidespread sales.\u201d\nPrices of food and non-alcoholic beverages also continued to ease, rising by 1.5% in the year to June 2024, the lowest rate since October 2021. The rate has eased for 15 months running now from a high of 19.2% in March 2023, the highest annual rate seen for over 45 years.\nFactory gate prices, paid by retailers, rose 1.4% on an annual basis, down from 1.7% in the year to May. Growth in input prices, paid by producers, dropped to 0.4% from 0.7% as fuel costs continued to decline.\n\u201cIt is welcome that inflation is at target, but we know that for families across Britain prices remain high,\u201d said Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury under Reeves.\nThis month\u2019s figures will help shape debate at the BOE on when to lower the benchmark lending rate, which officials left at a 16-year high for almost a year in order to curtail price pressures. Pill and others have signaled they want to see more concrete evidence that price pressures are subsiding before loosening policy.\nThe nine-member Monetary Policy Committee suggested in June that more officials were on the verge of backing a reduction, although some of its more hawkish members have voiced their opposition in recent weeks. Pill along with rate-setters Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskel all raised concerns over how quickly underlying pressures are cooling after a communications blackout during the election campaign.\n\u201cInflation stays on target, but honeymoon period may not last,\u201d said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. \u201cOur latest analysis sees UK inflation potentially rising to a high of 3% before the end of the year.\u201d\n--With assistance from Andrew Atkinson, Harumi Ichikura and Isabella Ward.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview\nWhy the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\nInterviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy\nHow Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\nHere\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Uk-Inflation-Holds-Boe-2-060311047.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.6711431146, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "GS", "Time": "2024-07-16T21:24:00.000Z", "Headline": "Goldman Sells $5.5 Billion of Bonds in Post-Earnings Binge", "Summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. joined rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the tapping the US investment-grade market after reporting second-quarter earnings.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad\nTrump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown on China\nAmazon Sold a Used Diaper.

The longest portion of the offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.17 percentage point above Treasuries, after initial discussions of around 1.45 percentage point, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\nProceeds from offering will be used for general corporate purposes and Goldman is the sole underwriter of the deal, added the person.\nGoldman\u2019s trading unit powered a surge in earnings in the second quarter. Both fixed-income and equity traders outpaced analysts\u2019 estimates, while a rebounding capital-markets business helped drive better-than-expected results across much of the company\u2019s Wall Street operations.\nWells Fargo, meanwhile, tapped the US high-grade market with a $2 billion perpetual securities offering a day after it raised \u20ac2.75 billion ($3 billion) in the European debt market.\nThis is the first sale of a preferred stock series by one of the so-called Big Six lenders in the US in almost two months, following a spurt of deals earlier this year when hopes of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve were fading. It\u2019s also Wells Fargo\u2019s first since last summer, when it effectively reopened a market that had remained shut since the regional banking crisis.\nThe new issue \u201clooks like a net AT1 addition (no refinancing),\u201d CreditSights Inc. analysts Jesse Rosenthal and George Milonopoulos wrote in a Tuesday client note. This refers to the role of preferred shares as a source of Additional Tier 1 capital for US banks, played by contingent convertible bonds in other parts of the world.\nRepresentatives for Goldman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo declined to comment.\nJPMorgan kicked off the issuance spree from the big banks on Monday, borrowing $9 billion in a four-part offering that garnered over $28 billion in investor demand. The longest portion of the deal, an 11-year tranche, drew upwards of $12 billion in orders. That allowed the lender to pay just low single-digit concessions to sell the debt, Bloomberg\u2019s Brian Smith wrote in a note.\nMore on the Way\nThe top banks are expected to borrow more than they usually do after they post earnings as they take advantage of falling yields and get ahead of upcoming US elections that could potentially bring market turmoil. The big banks are some of the largest issuers of investment grade corporate debt and their funding decisions help set the tone for the rest of that market.\nJPMorgan credit analyst Kabir Caprihan expects $21 billion to $24 billion of issuance from the six biggest domestic banks, more than the 10-year July average of roughly $17 billion. Barclays analysts including Peter Troisi are calling for about $30 billion in the third quarter, with most of that expected this month.\nBank of America Corp. reported trading and investment-banking results that topped analysts\u2019 estimates while Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading business posted the biggest increase among its peers in the second quarter. The two lenders, alongside Citigroup Inc. are also candidates to sell debt this month.\n\u2018Unwarranted\u2019 Angst\nGlobal systemically important banks have borrowed an average of $21 billion in the US high-grade market in the four weeks following earnings every year since 2014, JPMorgan analysts Eric Beinstein and Nathaniel Rosenbaum wrote in a research note on Tuesday.\n\u201cMany investors tend to be cautious on bank spreads heading into these heavy supply weeks but the historical data suggests this is unwarranted,\u201d wrote the analysts.\nBank bond spreads \u2014 and in some cases bank stocks \u2014 have outperformed during the heavy supply weeks, according to the note. The average spread on a financial institution bond is just 4 basis points wider than the broader high-grade index.\n\u201cThis suggests that it is the strength of bank earnings that have, over the past 10 years, contributed to the outperformance of both bank stocks and bonds,\u201d they wrote.\n--With assistance from Brian Smith and Tasos Vossos.\n(Updates to show the deals have priced.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview\nWhy the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\nInterviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy\nHere\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Goldman-Wells-Fargo-Join-Big-133041138.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.0098775942, "Sentiment_Category": "neutral"}, {"Ticker": "GS", "Time": "2024-07-16T20:52:00.000Z", "Headline": "Former Goldman Banker Pleads Not Guilty to Charges of Bribing Ghanaian Officials", "Summary": "Asante Berko\u2019s arraignment comes three years after the Goldman banker settled a related civil case with U.S. securities regulators.\nContinue Reading", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/M/Be2D1872-263F-32B5-B63D-252Ef357E356/Former-Goldman-Banker-Pleads.Html", "Sentiment_Score": -0.5374256372, "Sentiment_Category": "bearish"}, {"Ticker": "GS", "Time": "2024-07-16T20:33:45.000Z", "Headline": "Gold Jumps to Record as Traders Ramp Up Bets on Fed Rate Pivot", "Summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Gold hit a record high as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts grow and some traders ramped up bets on a second Donald Trump presidency.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad\nTrump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown on China\nAmazon Sold a Used Diaper.

The rally comes as signs of slowing inflation in the US fuel speculation the central bank will soon start lowering interest rates. High rates tend to be negative for gold, which bears no interest.\nEven so, the metal has still soared nearly 20% this year, supported by large purchases from central banks, strong consumer appetite in China and demand for haven assets amid geopolitical tensions. A recent uptick in holdings by exchange-traded funds is also aiding upward momentum.\n\u201cOptimism about US interest rate cuts as more economic data supports the case for a Fed pivot is supporting gold,\u201d Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING Bank NV, said earlier on Tuesday. \u201cGold is poised to keep its positive momentum going amid the current global geopolitical and macroeconomic landscape, while central bank demand is expected to grow.\u201d\nOn Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recent data had given policymakers greater confidence that inflation is heading down to the central bank\u2019s 2% goal, and traders now see two quarter-point rate reductions this year.\nTraders have been adding bets there will be three cuts this year after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said conditions were ripe for easing, with \u201ca solid rationale\u201d for officials to lower rates as soon as July.\nGold\u2019s latest rally isn\u2019t necessarily unexpected. In June, consultancy Metals Focus predicted a fresh record this year, while earlier this month Citigroup Inc. said its base case for gold in 2025 was $2,700-$3,000 an ounce.\nTrump momentum\nInvestors across markets are also weighing the likelihood that Trump will return to the White House, as his candidacy gains momentum following a failed assassination attempt over the weekend and the dismissal of a criminal case against him.\nGold could draw some support from a Trump presidency, said David Higgins, head of trading at Merrion Gold.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll cause lots of people to buy when he\u2019s elected,\u201d because retail customers \u2014 mainly smaller buyers \u2014 associate him with instability, Higgins said.\nSpot gold was up 1.9% at $2,467.58 an ounce as of 4:31 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed, while US 10-year Treasury yields fell.

US Magistrate Judge Vera Scanlon agreed to release Berko on $600,000 bond, though he will remain under house arrest with electronic monitoring at the Manhattan home of his sister-in-law.\nHe is due back in court for a conference on August 14.\nBerko\u2019s extradition comes four years after the onetime Goldman vice president was charged in a 2020 indictment filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York. They accused him of conspiring with at least two officials of the West African nation and four others in a bribery scheme they say benefited Goldman, himself and a Turkish energy company that sought to build a power plant in Ghana.\nBerko has been in British custody since since his 2022 arrest at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. In May his lawyers argued that a court order to extradite him should be dismissed, contending the charges weren\u2019t extradition offenses and that most of the alleged acts took place in London, but they failed to stop his transfer.\nPay to Play\nBerko was a member of the Goldman team responsible for securing and managing financing for the power plant project, according to the indictment. The US alleges that Berko paid bribes to obtain approvals for the Turkish company, in which Goldman held a 16% stake. Prosecutors also claim he laundered the bribe money through US financial institutions.\nBoyd Johnson, a lawyer for Berko, didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on the extradition.\nGoldman, which wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing in the matter, has been entangled in foreign bribery cases before, most famously the looting of Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB. In that case, it agreed to pay more than $5 billion, including a $2.3 billion fine in the US, and its Malaysia unit entered a guilty plea, a first for the firm. It was the largest penalty in US history for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nBerko was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 over the same basic alleged conduct. He resolved that lawsuit by agreeing to pay more than $329,000 to regulators without admittting or denying the allegations, court records show.\nHidden From Goldman\nAccording to the SEC, Berko was a vice president in Goldman\u2019s natural resources group before he resigned in December 2016. He went on to serve as managing director of Ghana\u2019s state-owned Tema Oil Refinery Ltd. but stepped down after the SEC suit was filed.\nUS authorities say Berko hid the alleged scheme from Goldman\u2019s compliance department. The bank has said it cooperated fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation.\nThe case is US v.

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer.\nThe earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without consent.\nThis call is being recorded today, July 15, 2024. I will now turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. We are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured.\nIt is a sad moment for our country. There's no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society.\nTurning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first half of the year.\nWe continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announced and completed M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting.\nOur investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of a capital markets and M&A recovery. And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well-positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FICC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and financing needs.\nWe continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share. And we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 118 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter.\nOur assets under supervision hit a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a 23% margin for the first half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM.\nIn alternatives, we raised $36 billion year to date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies.\nGiven the stronger than anticipated fundraising in the first half of the year as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to our investment performance track record and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset wealth management platform.\nLet me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there's a high level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policies and inflation has proven to be stickier than many had anticipated.\nOn the other hand, the environment in the US remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs.\nI am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon Valley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting-edge of technology and AI.\nWe all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovations and technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it significant demand related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise.\nBefore I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results, the year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests.\nGiven this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well-positioned to serve our clients and we'll continue to be nimble with our capital.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter. We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, which underscores our confidence in the durability of our franchise.\nSince the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public company.\nWe went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm and it's been an eventful 25 years. Since then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dot-com bubble, Nasdaq crash, September 11, a financial crisis, and the pandemic.\nWhen I look back at how we overcame these challenges, I immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stay true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people.\nIn closing, I am very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths, effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail.\nDenis Coleman\nThank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 11.6%.\nNow turning to performance by segment, starting on page 4. Global banking and markets produced revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period.\nEquity underwriting revenues rose 25% year over year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. Low volumes remain well below longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leveraged finance activity. We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity.\nOur backlog rose significantly quarter on quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FICC net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year over year. Intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies. FICC financing revenues were $850 million, a near record and up 37% year over year.\nEquities net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 7% year on year as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially.\nTaken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2 billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FICC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base.\nI'm moving to asset wealth management on page 5. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year over year. As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion.\nManagement and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707 million.\nOur premier ultra-high-net-worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products, a great example of the power of this unique platform.\nWe expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the first half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium-term target.\nNow moving to page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by $31 billion of long-term net inflows, largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows.\nTurning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $548 million in management and other fees. Gross third party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the first half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion.\nOn page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non-interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115 million related to our wholesale portfolio.\nTurning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio of net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full year, we continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 22%.\nNext capital on slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirements, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter.\nWe will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement. Our Board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise.\nIn conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record first half revenues across FICC and equities financing, management and other fees, and private banking in lending, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Glenn Schorr, Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr\nHi there. Thanks very much. So I liked your forward-leaning comments on the IB fee pipeline. And I think I heard you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high. Does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inflection point in private equity related M&A, sponsor-related M&A? And then how much of an event do you think you have as being maybe the only big bank that has a full-on private credit platform, and obviously, DCM platform, and lending platform? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon\nSure. Good morning, Glenn, and thanks for the question. We're forward leaning on our comments because we definitely see momentum pickup. But I just again want to highlight something that was definitely my part of the script. But I think Denis amplified, which we're still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10-year averages.\nAnd so for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on M&A. One of the reasons that M&A activity -- one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so I think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025, kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity.\nWe're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. And obviously, it's been way, way below the overall M&A activity has kind of another 20% to get to high 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that, and we're starting to see that increase.\nNow as that increases, I just think the firm is incredibly well-positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. We've been top kind of one, two, three, and what I'll call leveraged finance activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private credit platform.\nAnd so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position. The size and the scope of the companies that are out there, that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds, you know, to their limited partners, I think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last 2, 2.5 years.\nGlenn Schorr\nI appreciate that. Maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? Can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman\nSure, Glenn. It's Dennis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. And the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So that is, I think, a large explain of the delta.\nOperator\nEbrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala\nHey, good morning. I just wanted to spend some time on capital, post the SCB increase, one, maybe just from a business standpoint. If you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the firm has been leaning into the financing business. Do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? So one, how does it impact the business?\nAnd second, Denis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1Q levels of buybacks going forward? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman\nSure, Ebrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess first important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. So we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise.\nAnd with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing as David was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses. We have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders.\nGiven the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders.\nEbrahim Poonawala\nGot it. So assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the financing business. And just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity, we waited all year for things to pick up. Is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? Does it speak to inflated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? Just would love any context there, David if you could. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon\nSure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point, there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds.\nAnd as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. But I just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. I'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to go back to more normalized levels.\nEbrahim Poonawala\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nBetsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck\nHi, good morning. All right. Well, thanks very much. I did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but I'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? Or is this just a one-off given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?\nDavid Solomon\nSure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we always do, which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves.\nBetsy Graseck\nOkay. And as we anticipate a continued pick up here in M&A, given everything you mentioned earlier, I would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way. Would you agree with that or do I have something wrong there? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman\nNo, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. And we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations.\nBetsy Graseck\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nBrennan Hawken, UBS.\nBrennan Hawken\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged, Denis, the record financing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. And it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reflect balance growth. So one, I want to confirm that that's fair? And could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon?\nDenis Coleman\nSure. Thank you, Brennan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. We have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products.\nThe business is very diversified by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. That's something that we're going to remain mindful of. But we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.\nBrennan Hawken\nOkay. And then next question is really sort of a follow-on from Betsy's line of questioning. So year-to-date you've got a 64% efficiency ratio. You know, when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment -- consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily, you know, how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? You know, could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efficiency ratio?\nDenis Coleman\nSure. So thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously, our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency.\nBut ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that.\nAnd we do have a very granular process internally, looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top-line revenues.\nOperator\nMike Mayo, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo\nHi. I'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. I mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. You have record financing for equities and FICC combined. You're number one in M&A. You have record management fees. You have record assets under supervision.\nYour efficiency has gone from 74% to 64%, increased your dividend by 9% to signal your confidence, your CET1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher Fed requirements. David, you started off the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 11% ROE in the second quarter, that's not quite the 15% where you wanted to be. So where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon\nYeah, thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey. And, you know, the way I look at it, our returns for the first-half of the year at 12.8%. There are, you know, I think there are a couple of things gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through, and so that will come out. And at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the first-half of the year would be a little higher exit.\nAnd then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I obviously can't predict. But if you look at the returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm. And we're going to continue to focus on that.\nNow the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the AWM ROE is not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've got the margin up to 23%, but the ROE is still around 10%.\nWe think we can continue to grow the business. As we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM ROE. And then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile. So I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not work to do for sure. But we feel good about the progress.\nMike Mayo\nAnd I assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in. Can you just describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on past cycles?\nDavid Solomon\nWhat I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously, if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that.\nBut as a general matter, when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance sheets. They need to manage risks through structured transactions. And so there's a multiplier effect as those activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the M&A side.\nMike Mayo\nAnd then lastly, for your returns, the denominator is a big factor. So how does that work with the Fed? I know you can't say too much and reasonable people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the Fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. So how does this process work from here? Will we hear results about the SCB ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors?\nDavid Solomon\nLook, as a general matter, what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.\nHowever, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks transparency. It contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect the significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year over year.\nNow, despite all that, you know, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital flexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But obviously we have more work to do, given this result.\nMike Mayo\nAll right, thank you.\nOperator\nSteven Chubak, Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak\nHi, Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question. Just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. They were down only modestly despite the absence of the Green Sky contribution. Just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look at the next quarter?\nDenis Coleman\nSo, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the Green Sky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.\nSteven Chubak\nUnderstood and maybe just one more clarifying question. I know there's been a lot asked about the SCB. Really just wanted to better understand, Denis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal.\nJust how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to Basel III Endgame. There's certainly been some favorable momentum as per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? But just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the SCB and Basel III Endgame, where you're comfortable running on a CET1 basis over the near to medium term?\nDenis Coleman\nSure, thanks, and I appreciate that question. I think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal flexibility. And certainly, embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to Basel III Endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution.\nIt sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that I think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to support clients, return capital to shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.\nSteven Chubak\nHelpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nDevin Ryan, Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan\nAll right, great. Good morning, David and Denis. A couple questions on AWM progress. So the first one is on the alts business specifically, and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium-term target for annual incentive fees? And now with over $500 billion in alts AUM and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative.\nSo I appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in AUM there?\nDenis Coleman\nSo Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective.\nWe do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously bounce around from time-to-time. It is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years.\nSo I think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know, should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.\nDevin Ryan\nYeah, okay, thanks, Denis. And then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin profile of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers, so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35%-plus for alts and some of the public firms we know are obviously well above that.\nSo I appreciate you're running the AWM segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts AUM isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in '24. So just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well?\nDenis Coleman\nSo that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall AWM margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy.\nAnd so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.\nDevin Ryan\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nDan Fannon, Jefferies.\nDan Fannon\nThanks, good morning. In terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about?\nDenis Coleman\nSure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year.\nBut our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year.\nDan Fannon\nUnderstood. And as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. The private credit fund closing here in the first-half was big.\nCan you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year?\nDenis Coleman\nSure. So you know, obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know, once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the first-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year.\nAnd I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure. We had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter, but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.\nOperator\nMatt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor\nGood morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape specifically in banking and markets. I know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know, are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago.\nAnd all these regional banks that I cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. So you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. And I'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point?\nDavid Solomon\nSure, Matt, and I appreciate the question. I just say, you know, investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at.\nThere's always going to be competition, there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading M&A share for 25-years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. An then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk I think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time.\nAnd so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and financial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions us very well. They'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.\nMatt O'Connor\nOkay helpful and agreed. And then just separately, I hate to ask you about activity levels and stuff like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe I'll frame it. From your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? Do they kind of say, well, let's wait and see the other side? Is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon\nThere are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but I think we're well-positioned to serve our clients. Regardless of the environment, the clients are very active at the moment, and I think they're probably going to continue to be active.\nMatt O'Connor\nThank you.\nOperator\nGerard Cassidy, RBC.\nGerard Cassidy\nThank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David, you said in your opening comments that you took the Board out to Silicon Valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for Goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that.\nCan you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing within Goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efficient?\nDavid Solomon\nSure, I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service firm and a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very, very powerful tool.\nSo if you look and you think across the scale of our business, I think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious.\nYou can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter you're all analysts on the phone. There's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what I'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there.\nWhen you look at the data sets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. For our engineering stack and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful.\nSo those are a handful, there are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But again, I'd step back. Well, this will increase our productivity. The thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. And that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. People will need to make investment, they'll need financing, they'll need to scale. And so we're excited about that broad opportunity.\nGerard Cassidy\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, Denis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? It seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book?\nDenis Coleman\nSure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, the charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment.\nSo while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future.\nAnd although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments, given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%.\nGerard Cassidy\nThank you.\nOperator\nSaul Martinez, HSBC.\nSaul Martinez\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on capital, I mean, it certainly is encouraging that your CET1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- I think, a [$16 billion] reduction in RWA as your presentation talks about credit RWA is falling this quarter? I guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? And I guess more importantly, is there a continued room for RWA optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?\nDenis Coleman\nSure, thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions both in credit and market risk RWAs. Drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure, and in some places lower levels of volatility.\nWe try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. So that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed. And it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under.\nSaul Martinez\nThank you, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up on financing, FICC financing up 37%, equities -- equity financing is now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. I guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know, to continue to grow from here? How much more space is there, you know, to use finding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients?\nDenis Coleman\nThat's a good question, Saul. I think on the FICC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And you know, we think based on what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunity set across the client portfolio.\nSo we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business.\nIn equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients.\nAnd clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both FICC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow.\nSaul Martinez\nOkay, great, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you.

Overall, BlackRock ended the quarter with record AUM (Assets Under Management) of over $10.6 trillion.\nOperating income of $1.9 billion and EPS of $10.36 spiked 12% respectively with Q2 sales of $4.8 billion expanding 8%. This was attributed to the positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market movement on average AUM.

Year over year, Q2 earnings soared 180% from $3.08 a share in the comparative quarter. Quarterly sales increased 17% while total operating expenses were nicely down to $8.53 billion which fueled Goldman\u2019s increased profitability.\nNotably, Goldman\u2019s AUM increased by $86 billion and is also sitting at record levels of $2.93 trillion. Goldman also ranked as the worldwide leader in announced and completed mergers so far this year seeing strength in its Global Banking and Asset & Wealth Management segments.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance & Valuation Comparison\nYear to date, Goldman\u2019s stock has soared +50% to impressively top the S&P 500\u2019s +25% while BlackRock\u2019s +13% has lagged the broader market. \nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStill, BlackRock's stock trades at 20X forward earnings with Goldman at 13.2X, offering nice discounts to the S&P 500\u2019s 23.6X.\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nBlackrock and Goldman Sachs\u2019 stock currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The rise was driven by higher revenues from consumer platforms.\nCapital Ratios Improves\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.8%, up 14.6% on a sequential basis. The company\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%, which remained unchanged from the previous quarter.\nCapital Distribution Update\nDuring the reported quarter, Goldman returned $4.43 billion of capital to common shareholders.

Strong performance in IB, FICC financing revenues and consumer banking business acted as a tailwind.

However, he notes a mixed picture in the overall banking sector regarding net interest income (NII). While acknowledging the positive start in capital markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC), Ryan emphasizes, \"I think we're still in the early days of a recovery in capital markets. So good to see the start, but I think there's a lot more to go here.\"\nAddressing fixed income performance, Ryan observes: \"Fixed income and equities trading have been more resilient than we would've thought heading into the year.\" He further notes that as issuance and M&A activity pick up, this sector still has \"room to grow.\"\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.\nThis post was written by Angel Smith", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/Video/Goldman-Sachs-Tops-Q2-Estimates-144942911.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.9012374878, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "GS", "Time": "2024-07-15T14:47:00.000Z", "Headline": "Big Banks Helped by Wall Street Comeback", "Summary": "The dealmaking that Goldman Sachs and its peers rely on to power earnings is showing signs of life.

It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\nBoth fixed-income and equity traders outpaced analysts\u2019 estimates, while a rebounding capital-markets business helped drive better-than-expected results across much of the company\u2019s Wall Street operations.\nStill, in a surprise reversal, the company pocketed less in fees from arranging mergers than JPMorgan Chase & Co. Goldman tends to lead the industry in that business and rarely falls behind its rival.\nEven as more businesses are on the prowl for deals, the approaching US elections could further delay a return to the pace of growth in the mergers seen in recent years. The business is especially important for Goldman because the firm has tried to showcase its strong investment bank and growing asset-management operation, after abandoning an expansion into consumer banking.\nEarnings in the second quarter were 2.5 times higher than what Goldman posted a year ago, when it was plagued by losses in real estate investments and the consumer-banking unit in the middle of an industrywide dealmaking slowdown. Net income was $3.04 billion on $12.7 billion in revenue in the three months through June 30, according to a statement Monday.\nShares of the New York-based firm pared earlier gains after the company said it plans to moderate the pace of buybacks because regulators increased Goldman\u2019s capital-buffer requirement. The stock, which reached an all-time high of $479.88 on Friday, advanced 0.6% at 10:06 a.m. in New York.\n\u201cThe year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we\u2019ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cGiven this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations.\u201d\nStrategy Shuffle\nLast month, in a surprise move, the bank tapped John Mahoney, a financial-services banker who has been with the firm since 1987, to oversee firmwide strategy. That\u2019s a departure from recent years, when Goldman had been tapping younger, fast-rising executives destined for bigger jobs at the firm for a similar role. The firm is also turning to a merger banker for a strategy role at a time when it has preached caution about the need for acquisitions to grow, especially after pursuing multiple deals to build out a retail-banking business that flopped.\nGoldman has instead tried to pare its focus to expanding its investment bank and money-management business to achieve its mid-teens return-on-equity target. It fell short of that mark in the second quarter, notching 10.9%.\nThe fixed-income trading business posted $3.18 billion in revenue, driven by strength in rates and currencies. The stock-trading unit logged $3.17 billion. Goldman touted its second-best quarter ever across both businesses in financing revenue.\nInvestment-banking revenue of $1.73 billion fell short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.8 billion. Merger-advisory fees were $688 million. That was less than the $785 million that JPMorgan reported last week.\nGoldman\u2019s equity capital markets business generated $423 million in revenue, and debt-underwriting revenue was $622 million.\nThe asset- and wealth-management business posted revenue of $3.88 billion, up 27% from a year earlier. Management fees climbed 8% as the bank seeks to shift growth to those fees instead of windfalls from balance-sheet investments.\nGoldman said last quarter that it raised its biggest war chest yet for private-credit wagers. The firm closed the latest iteration of its direct-lending fund, which along with separately managed accounts for the same strategy amounted to $21 billion. The bank also clinched a $43 billion mandate to invest pension-fund assets of parcel-delivery company UPS, in one of the largest deals of its kind.\nThat progress has helped the bank stay on track to exceed a target is spelled out earlier this year of raising $50 billion in alternative assets.\nIn consumer banking, revenue was up 4% and transaction-banking fees dropped 15% from a year earlier. Those businesses are part of the unit that the bank has been disassembling as it reverses its push into retail banking.\n(Adds buyback commentary starting in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nAsia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\nFrench Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "Link": "Https://Finance.Yahoo.Com/News/Goldman-Sachs-Profit-Surges-Traders-112742939.Html", "Sentiment_Score": 0.4125262499, "Sentiment_Category": "bullish"}, {"Ticker": "GS", "Time": "2024-07-15T14:00:03.000Z", "Headline": "Goldman (GS) Q2 Earnings: Taking a Look at Key Metrics Versus Estimates", "Summary": "Goldman Sachs (GS) reported $12.73 billion in revenue for the quarter ended June 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 16.9%.

Trajectory was sharper in particular units: Asset and wealth management, for example, saw revenue pop by 27% to $3.9 billion.\nInvestment banking fees jumped 21%. That percentage may pale in comparison to the likes of JPMorgan Chase, which reported a 46% second-quarter increase, and Citi, whose fees saw a 60% jump.\nGoldman CFO Denis Coleman, on Monday\u2019s earnings call, noted that the bank still had a No. 1 market share for mergers, according to CNBC.\nEven the bank\u2019s losses seemed to fall significantly from this time last year. Goldman reported a $282 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter. That\u2019s 54% less than in April through June last year.\nOn a more molecular level, Goldman took a $58 million charge related to its credit card business with General Motors. GM is reportedly in talks to replace Goldman with Barclays as its partner. Apple also is reportedly looking to end its credit card partnership with Goldman.\nIf enthusiasm seems muted at Goldman, that might be from the top down.\n\"We are pleased with our solid second quarter results and our overall performance in the first half of the year, reflecting strong year-on-year growth in both Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management,\" CEO David Solomon said Monday. (Global banking and markets reported a 14% jump in revenue Monday.)\nSome of the tension likely derives from a still-stinging stress test result, in which the Federal Reserve set a 6.4% stress capital buffer for the bank \u2014 and a 13.9% common equity tier 1 requirement.\n\u201cThe year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we\u2019ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests,\u201d Solomon said during Monday\u2019s call, according to Bloomberg. \u201cGiven this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations.\u201d\nIndeed, Goldman challenged its stress test result in a letter to the Fed, the Financial Times reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe Fed has allowed banks to dispute stress test results since 2020. But although eight, including Goldman once before, have written appeals disagreeing with the outcomes, the Fed has yet to budge on its initial assessments.\nThe Fed is expected to recheck its test of Goldman for any errors and to disclose its verdict on the appeal in August, according to the Financial Times.\nThis story was originally published on Banking Dive.
